        "transcription": "the arrow of time is one of the biggest Unsolved Mysteries in physics the laws of physics don't care about time's Direction so why does time only move forward a glass shatters its pieces scattering across the floor but they never leap back together at the microscopic level the universe doesn't seem to have a preference for forward or backward the laws governing particles and forces are time reversible an electron doesn't care if it's moving into the future or retreating into the past it behaves the same way either direction and yet here we are moving in One Direction always forward why this question has haunted scientists for centuries among them was Rudolph closius a 19th century physicist who introduced the idea of entropy a measure of disorder in a system a cold glass of water has low entropy pour in some hot water and the heat spreads out evenly that's high entropy ropy clausius realized that in any isolated system entropy always increases this became the second law of Thermodynamics one of the most unyielding principles in science this clausius realized was the arrow of Time Imagine a perfect cup of coffee dark liquid untouched cream you pour the cream in and at first it dances beautiful swirling edies of white and black but over time time those delicate patterns dissolve into an even Brown the system has gone from order to disorder from low entropy to high entropy and there's no going back but here's the haunting part if entropy always increases then at some point it must have been incredibly low in the earliest moments after the big bang the universe was a staggering portrait of order balanced on a knife's edge but why why did the universe start in such a bizarrely ordered State why wasn't it born chaotic and unstructured this is where the mystery deepens some physicists suggest that the universe itself is an entropy generating machine as it expands new space forms and with it more opportunities for entropy to increase like ink spreading on an infinite canvas but this only explains what happens after the big bang it doesn't explain the universe's initial low entropy State others like physicist Julian Barber have suggested something more unsettling time might not exist at all barar envisions the universe as a Timeless landscape a series of Frozen moments like individual frames on an infinite film reel we perceive them in sequence but they all exist simultaneously past present and future locked together in an eternal Tableau if this is true then time itself the arrow we cling to so dearly might be an illusion a trick of perspective and then there's the Multiverse hypothesis what if our universe is just one bubble in an endless Cosmic foam in most bubbles entropy might have started high and time might not flow at all perhaps our universe is a statistical anomaly an extraordinarily rare pocket of low entropy in a sea of chaos but these answers feel like whispers in the dark grains of sand slipping through our fingers each Theory offers a glimpse but none hold the full picture entropy grows Stars Burn galaxies Collide and someday entropy will win the universe will run out of ways to rearrange itself Stars will fade into Embers black holes will evaporate and the cosmos will fall into a silent cold equilibrium a state physicist call heat death time will stop not because it's broken but because there will be no difference between yesterday and tomorrow nothing will happen ever again but that's billions of years away for now the shattered glass stays broken the cream swirls into coffee and tomorrow still Waits just Out Of Reach time moves forward carrying us with it a cosmic river flowing from the improbable order of the past into the chaotic unknown of the future the arrow of time remains one of the deepest most unsettling mysteries of our universe and yet somewhere hidden in the mathematics of entropy the Frozen Landscapes of Timeless moments or the chaotic probabilities of the Multiverse lies the answer matter antimatter a symmetry the universe as we know it shouldn't exist not in the way we see it not with galaxies spiraling through the void nor stars burning with nuclear fire nor planets orbiting in Serene silence and certainly not with you here listening to this story according to the fundamental laws of physics every particle of matter the protons neutrons and electrons that make up everything should have been perfectly matched by its antimatter twin a proton mirrored by an antiproton an El Elon by a positron and when matter and antimatter meet they annihilate each other in a burst of pure energy leaving behind nothing but light if the universe had followed these rules perfectly there would have been no planets no stars and certainly no life there would only be a cold empty void a silent Afterglow of annihilation but that didn't happen something somewhere broke the balance somehow matter one today we find ourselves standing on the fragile residue of this imbalance for every billion pairs of particles and antiparticles that formed in the earliest moments of creation one extra particle of matter remained and from that one in a billion imbalance came everything the galaxies the Stars the swirling gas clouds and the atoms in your body but why what happened in those first moments of the universe that tilted the scales in favor of matter and how did such an unimaginably tiny difference lead to everything we see today to answer this question we have to travel back not just to the Big Bang but to the chaotic superheated moments that followed in those first fractions of a second the universe was a seething turbulent sea of particles popping in and out of existence energy and matter were interchangeable and symmetry reigned supreme but as the universe expanded and cooled something strange happened symmetry broke the pristine balance between matter and antimatter was disrupted ever so slightly and it's in this disruption that the secret of our existence lies in the 1960s the Soviet physicist Andre sakarov laid out the blueprint for how such an imbalance could have emerged according to sakarov three critical conditions needed to be met in those early moments first the universe had to allow matter and antimatter to behave differently a violation of something called CP symmetry second the universe needed to be out of equilibrium a chaotic state where particles and antiparticles didn't have equal chances to interact and third there had to be a way to create more matter than antimatter through these interactions it sounded simple enough but actually finding these violations proved far more challenging in 1964 physicists James Cronin and Val Fit made a discovery that would shake the foundations of particle physics while studying particles called chons they observed a tiny but unmistakable violation of CP symmetry in certain rare interactions chons and their antimatter counterparts behaved slightly differently it was the first hard evidence that nature did have a pre however subtle for matter over antimatter but there was a problem the CP violation seen in chons was far too small to explain the universe we see today it was like finding a faint scratch on a massive wall and trying to claim it explained the collapse of an entire building clearly something else was at play in recent decades physicists have turned their attention to one of the most elusive particles in the cosmos the neutrino neutrinos are ghost-like particles that barely interact with the rest of the universe trillions of them are passing through your body right now unnoticed some theories suggest that neutrinos might hold the key to matter antimatter asymmetry specifically if neutrinos are what's known as majera particles particles that are their own antiparticles they might have decayed in the early Universe in a way that slightly favored matter this process known as leptogenesis could have created the tiny imbalance that eventually led to the universe we see today but detecting and studying neutrinos is like trying to capture Shadows with your bare hands experiments deep underground shielded from the noise of the world above are carefully watching for the faintest hint of neutrino behavior that could confirm this Theory and yet the answers remain just Out Of Reach Whispers in the Dark hints in the noise there's also another idea one that's as bold as it is unsettling what if antimatter isn't missing at all what if it's simply somewhere else some physicists speculate that entire regions of the universe could be made of antimatter galaxies antimatter stars and antimatter planets if these regions exist they would be separated from matter by vast Gulfs of emptiness because where the two meet annihilation would light up the cosmos like fireworks but here's the thing we've never seen these fireworks The Telltale gamma ray signatures of matter and antimatter colliding on Cosmic scales are absent from our observations wherever antimatter went if it went anywhere at all it seems to have left no trace and so the mystery deepens somewhere in the equations of particle physics in the decays of chons in The elusive flicker of neutr or perhaps in the far reaches of the cosmos the answer is waiting an answer that could explain not only why matter exists but why we exist it's strange to think that our entire universe the vast galaxies the burning stars and the life teeming on our small blue planet owes its existence to an imperfection a flaw a tiny imbalance in the Machinery of creation the universe broke its own symmetry and from that imperfection came everything but was it truly an accident was it a statistical fluke a cosmic coin flip that happened to land on edge or is there something deeper something fundamental woven into the laws of physics a reason why the universe preferred matter over antimatter for now the answer remains hidden scattered across particle colliders deep space telescopes and Subterranean neutrino detectors and with every experiment every flash of light on a detector screen we move one step closer to understanding the imbalance that gave rise to everything one day the universe may will give up its secret and when it does we'll finally know why there's something instead of nothing Quantum tunneling at the heart of reality lies a rule book a set of fundamental laws that dictate How the Universe behaves these laws are steadfast reliable and for the most part predictable drop a ball and it will fall heat flows from hot to cold a brick wall stops you in your tracks but beneath this seemingly stable surface deep in the quantum World reality starts to misbehave particles don't play by the same rules they flicker they blur and sometimes they do something extraordinary they pass through barriers as if they weren't even there this is quantum tunneling one of the strangest phenomena in all of physics imagine standing in front of a mountain you could spend years trying to climb over it or dig your way under it but in the classical world the world of large objects governed by Newtonian physics you would never expect to Simply pass through it yet in the bizarre world of quantum mechanics particles can do just that electrons protons even entire atoms have been observed performing this impossible Escape act but how does it work and perhaps more intriguingly are there limits to this Quantum magic to understand tunneling we first need to understand how particles behave in the quantum World in our everyday experience particles are distinct well-defined objects a marble on a table is either here or there but in the quantum realm particles behave both both like particles and like waves a duality that defies intuition instead of having a single position a Quantum particle exists as a probability wave a mathematical Haze of possible locations picture throwing a stone into a pond ripples spread out in all directions in the same way a Quantum particle's wave function spreads across space representing the probability of finding the particle at different location now imagine placing a wall in the path of these ripples classically the ripples would stop at the barrier but Quantum mechanically the wave function doesn't vanish completely it leaks through on the other side of the wall there's still a faint Ripple a tiny probability that the particle could tunnel through the barrier and appear where it shouldn't be this isn't just abstract Theory Quantum tunneling is the engine behind some of the most important processes in the the universe inside the heart of stars hydrogen nuclei overcome their natural repulsion to fuse together releasing energy in the form of light and heat classically the repulsion between their positive charges should make fusion nearly impossible but thanks to Quantum tunneling these particles can sneak through their energy barriers allowing stars to shine here on Earth tunneling forms the backbone of Technologies like scanning tunneling microscopes which allow science ssts to see individual atoms by exploiting the tunneling of electrons it's also critical in Technologies like flash memory where electrons tunnel through insulating layers to store information in your smartphone or computer but as miraculous as Quantum tunneling seems It's Not Without its limits for tunneling to happen the barrier can't be too thick nor can it be too tall the particle must have some probability of reaching the other side as the barrier grows taller or wider the likelihood of successful tunneling drops exponentially in a sense tunneling isn't a cheat code to bypass reality it's more like rolling an infinite set of dice and hoping for a miracle and yet physicists are pushing the limits of tunneling in Laboratories around the world scientists have managed to Tunnel entire molecules and clusters of atoms through barriers stretching the boundaries of what seems possible but could something larger a virus a human cell or even a full human being ever tunnel through a wall theoretically yes practically almost certainly not the wave function of a complex object like a human is astronomically tiny the probability of every single particle in your body coordinating to Tunnel simultaneously is so unfathomably low that it borders on the impossible you'd have better odds of randomly assembling Shakespeare's Hamlet by throwing Scrabble tiles into the air but even at the microscopic scale tunneling isn't fully understood recently scientists have been exploring the time it takes for a particle to Tunnel does it happen instantly or does the particle actually travel through the barrier step by step experiments with ultra fast lasers suggest that tunneling might happen faster than we ever thought possible perhaps even instantaneously but this mystery remains unsolved lurking at the edge of our understanding and then there's the question of whether tunneling could reveal something deeper about the nature of reality itself could tunneling hint at Hidden Dimensions could it be a sign of physics beyond our current models some physicists believe that tunneling might offer a glimpse into The illusive Theory of Everything a framework that unites gravity quantum mechanics and the cosmos under a single elegant equation at its core Quantum tunneling is a reminder of just how strange and wonderful our universe really is it shows us that at the smallest scales reality isn't solid or predictable it's slippery probabilistic and deeply mysterious particles don't respect boundaries in the way we expect them to they blur the line between here and there between what is and what isn't so the next time you see light from a distant star or store a photo on your phone remember somewhere deep in the fabric of reality particles are breaking the rules they're sneaking through barriers defying expectations and reminding us that the universe is far stranger and far more beautiful than we ever imagined and perhaps just perhaps hidden within the limits of quantum tunneling lies the next great breakthrough in our understanding of reality the question isn't whether something will tunnel through that final barrier it's simply a matter of when oh my God Particle imagine a single proton a subatomic particle smaller than an atom traveling through the vast emptiness of space now imagine that proton moving so fast with so much energy that it could knock over a bowling pin from thousands of kilometers away if it ever stopped moving this isn't science fiction these particles are real and they're called ultra high energy cosmic rays the fastest and most mysterious Messengers in the universe but where do they come from how do they gain such extraordinary energy far beyond what we can achieve in our most advanced particle accelerators and perhaps the most puzzling question of all why do they seem to defy the known rules of physics it was the night of October 15th 1991 when scientists operating the flyes eye detector in Utah recorded something so extraordinary it felt almost like an error a single cosmic ray slammed into Earth's atmosphere releasing an energy equivalent to a baseball traveling at 100 kmph but this wasn't a baseball it was a single proton so small it could pass through your body unnoticed they called it the oh my God particle and for good reason its energy was so staggeringly high over 300 million times more energetic than particles produced in the Large Hadron Collider that it left physicists stunned to put it another way if this proton was scaled up to the size of a tennis ball it would have been traveling at nearly the speed of light with the energy of a rifle bullet but here's where it gets weird according to our understanding of physics particles like this shouldn't exist Cosmic microwave background radiation the faint glow left over from the big Big Bang should act like a speed bump draining energy from such particles over long distances and yet here it was a single proton defying every expectation where could something like this possibly come from cosmic rays are in many ways ghosts they don't travel in straight lines they zigzag chaotically through the universe twisted and deflected by Cosmic magnetic fields by the time they reach Earth they've long forgotten where they came from but physicists have a few suspects one of them is super massive black holes colossal engines of gravity that lurk at the centers of galaxies as matter falls into these behemoths it gets spun around and ejected in colossal Jets traveling close to the speed of light could these Jets act like Cosmic slingshots hurling particles into space with unimaginable energy another suspect is gamma r bursts the most violent explosions in the universe these bursts are so powerful that for a few brief moments they outshine entire galaxies if cosmic rays are being born in these cataclysms they could carry with them traces of their fiery origin but here's the problem neither Theory fits perfectly the directions these ultra high energy cosmic rays come from don't always align with known black holes or Gamay bursts it's as if these particles are hiding their Origins slipping through the universe like Cosmic assassins leaving no trace of where they began and so physicists have built massive observatories like the Pierre o observatory in Argentina an array of detectors spanning over 3,000 square kilm of land every so often one of these Ultra energetic particles crashes into Earth's atmosphere creating a shower of of secondary particles that Cascade downward in a brilliant flash detectable by these instruments but despite Decades of observations the mystery remains physics places a theoretical speed limit on ultra high energy cosmic rays it's called The gyen zaten kusman Limit according to this principle any cosmic ray traveling over vast distances should eventually lose energy as it interacts with the cosmic mic microwave background radiation the faint thermal glow left over from The Big Bang in other words if a particle is too energetic and has traveled too far it shouldn't have any energy left by the time it gets here and yet some ultra high energy cosmic rays seem to have violated this limit if these particles are coming from nearby sources we should have found them by now if they're coming from far away they shouldn't have this much energy the universe it seems is playing by rules we don't yet understand some physicists have started to wonder if ultra high energy cosmic rays might hint at new physics something beyond our current understanding of the universe one Theory suggests that these particles might not even be protons but something more exotic like strangelets hypothetical particles made of a type of Quark matter others propose that they might be leaking in from parallel universes crossing the thin boundary between realities and then there's the truly mind-bending possibility that these cosmic rays are revealing flaws in our understanding of SpaceTime itself could the universe at its deepest levels have hidden Dimensions or physical laws that only reveal themselves at these extraordinary energies ultra high energy cosmic rays are more than just scientific Curiosities they might be Messengers carrying Secrets written into the universe at its most extreme scales each one that crashes into our atmosphere brings with it a whisper from the cosmos a fragment of a story billions of light years long but the story remains unfinished the origins of these particles remain elusive their impossible energies remain unexplained and every time we detect one we are reminded of how little we truly know about the universe maybe the next part particle will bring an answer or perhaps it will only deepen the mystery for now the sky remains quiet scattered with stars and somewhere out there hidden in the cold Dark Void another ultra high energy cosmic ray is already on its way hurtling toward us with the energy of a thousand suns carrying with it a secret we have yet to decode white holes in the Grand Theater of the cosmos black holes are the most enigmatic characters Bottomless Pits where gravity Reigns Supreme and light itself cannot Escape they are cosmic one-way doors places where time distorts and matter meets an unknowable fate but what if there was another kind of door one not for entering but for exiting a mirror image of a black hole a theoretical object where nothing can go in only out these hypothetical objects are called white holes at first glance white holes sound more like science fiction than science they are mathematical predictions cousins to black holes emerging from the same equations of Einstein's general relativity but while black holes are well observed Across the Universe white holes remain elusive perhaps non-existent and yet they remain one of the most tantalizing mysteries in theoretical physics but to understand white holes we need to revisit their counterparts black holes in 1915 Albert Einstein published his theory of general relativity a mathematical Masterpiece that redefined our understanding of gravity space and time soon after physicist Carl schwarzschild solved Einstein's equations for a particularly extreme scenario what happens when a massive object collapses under its own weight compressing all its mass into an infinitely small point a singularity the result was the Schwarz child metric the first mathematical description of a black hole but buried within this solution was something strange an equally valid yet almost alien second solution it described an object with reversed Tim likee properties instead of pulling everything in this object pushed everything out instead of being a cosmic trap it was a cosmic Fountain the Schwarz sh solution had unintentionally predicted white holes but while black holes arise naturally from collapsing stars and observational evidence surrounds us white holes have a fundamental problem they seem impossible to create a black hole is born from collapse when a star Burns through its Fuel and gravitational forces crush it into an infinitesimal singularity but for a white hole to exist it would have to emerge already formed fully intact with nothing ever having entered it unlike black holes which devour everything in their path a white hole would be eternally sealed from the outside Universe it's like seeing a waterfall flowing upward in the real Universe white holes seem forbidden by the second law of Thermodynamics this law dictates that entropy the measure of disorder must always increase a white hole constantly spitting out matter and energy in an orderly manner would represent a universe where entropy decreases and that simply doesn't happen and yet the mathematics stubbornly insists that white holes are possible gamma ray bursts short intense flashes of high energy radiation are among the most energetic events in the universe they are so brief so powerful and so mysterious that scientists still don't fully understand what causes them some researchers have speculated could gamma ray bursts be the final size of white holes could these sudden chaotic emissions represent the last Escape of matter from an impossibly ancient white hole one that's collapsing or Vanishing into non-existence it's speculative very speculative but the connection isn't entirely absurd after all if white holes exist their signatures would be explosive unpredictable and unlike anything we've seen before here's where things get even stranger what if black holes and white holes aren't separate entities but two sides of the same coin a bridge a wormhole connecting a black hole's Singularity to a white hole's outflow in another region of the universe or even in an entirely different Universe this idea comes from the Ein rosenbridge a theoretical shortcut through SpaceTime predicted by relativity in this scenario every black hole would have a white hole twin connected through a wormhole but there's a catch these connections are inherently unstable the slightest disturbance say a single stray Photon would cause the Wormhole to collapse instantly sealing off any potential passage and yet the image remains haunting a cosmic bridge where m swallowed by a black hole emerges somewhere sometime from a white hole there's another idea equally bizarre black holes aren't Eternal they evaporate over time thanks to Hawking radiation a slow ghostly process where energy leaks away from the black hole's Event Horizon as a black hole shrinks closer and closer to nothingness could it eventually reverse could the final moment of a Dying black hole trigger the birth of a white hole ejecting its trapped contents back into the universe in one last chaotic burst of energy it's an idea that blends black holes white holes and quantum physics into one breathtaking possibility at its core the white hole problem might not be a problem of Relativity at all but a problem of quantum gravity The elusive theory that unites Einstein's grand Cosmic scales with the microscopic unpredictability of quantum mechanics some physicists speculate that white holes might exist in the quantum realm on unimaginably small scales flickering in and out of existence tied to the strange foamlike texture of SpaceTime itself they could be remnants of the early Universe tiny Echoes of the Big Bang scattered throughout reality but without a theory of quantum gravity these ideas remain Shadows on the wall of our ignorance after a century of speculation white holes remain trapped in the realm of theory they are mathematical Echoes beautiful but intangible carved into the equations of our universe but absent from our telescopes perhaps they're impossible prohibited by the fundamental laws of nature or perhaps they're out there hidden Beyond The Cosmic Horizon fleeting and rare waiting for us to find them but even if white holes never exist in our Universe their mathematics still teaches us something profound the universe is not just strange it's Stranger than we can imagine and somewhere in the equations of Relativity in The Whispers of Gamay bursts or in the dying breath of an evaporating black hole the answer might be waiting for now the mystery of white holes remains an Open Door one we cannot yet step through dark matter and dark energy in the grand expanse of the cosmos amidst the glittering tapestry of stars and galaxies there exists an unseen force a shadowy presence that dominates the universe it doesn't shine it doesn't reflect light and it doesn't interact with the world in any familiar way yet without it galaxies would fly apart Stars would scatter into the void and the universe as we know it would collapse into chaos this invisible force is dark matter and as if that weren't strange enough there's something even more elusive lurking in the vastness of space a mysterious energy that pushes galaxies apart stretching the very fabric of reality we call it dark energy together dark matter and dark energy make up over 95% of the universe everything we can see the stars the planets the gas clouds every atom and photon accounts for less than 5% the rest is Darkness not the comforting shadow of night but an inscrutable all-encompassing mystery woven into the structure of existence itself the story of Dark Matter begins nearly a century ago with an astronomer named Fritz zwicki in the 1930s zwicki was studying the coma cluster a massive collection of galaxies bound together by gravity using Newton's Laws of Motion he calculated how fast these galaxies should be moving based on the visible mass of the cluster the Stars the gas and everything they could observe but something didn't add up the galaxies were moving far too fast by all accounts they should have flown apart scattering into the cold void of space and yet they stayed together as if Bound by some unseen gravitational hand zwicki proposed the existence of something he called dunkl materi Dark Matter an invisible substance exerting gravitational pull holding the galaxies in place at first few took him seriously but decades later astronomer Vera Rubin would uncover striking evidence to support swick's idea studying the rotation curves of spiral galaxies Reuben noticed something bizarre according to Newtonian physics stars on the outskirts of a galaxy should orbit more slowly than those near the center much like planets in our solar system but they didn't the Stars at the edges moved just as fast as those closer in defying all expectations the only explanation was an unseen Mass a Halo of dark matter enveloping the Galaxy its gravitational influence stretching far beyond the visible stars but what is dark matter despite its profound influence on the universe we still don't know it doesn't emit light it doesn't absorb it and it doesn't collide with normal matter scientists believe it might be made of exotic particles wimps weakly interacting massive particles or axians hypothetical entities that interact only through gravity and the weak nuclear force experiments deep underground and in massive particle colliders are searching for these elusive particles but so far Dark Matter remains a ghost in the machine and yet the mystery deepens because if dark matter is the hidden scaffolding that holds galaxies together dark energy is the Invisible Hand pulling them apart in the late 1990s two teams of astronomers studying distant type IIA Supernova made a startling Discovery they expected to find that the expans expion of the universe was slowing down over time as gravity pulled galaxies back together instead they found the opposite the universe isn't just expanding it's accelerating something is counteracting gravity on the largest scales driving galaxies apart at ever increasing speeds this repulsive force is what we call dark energy and it accounts for nearly 70% of the total energy density of the universe its Discovery shattered our understanding of cosmology and raised a question that still haunts physicists what is dark energy one idea ties it to vacuum energy a property of empty space itself quantum mechanics tells us that even a perfect vacuum isn't truly empty it's a frothing sea of virtual particles constantly appearing and Vanishing this energy though minuscule might add up across the vastness of space creating a cosmic push that drives the universe apart another theory links dark energy to Einstein's cosmological constant a term he once introduced and later dismissed as a mathematical fix in his equations of general relativity but with the discovery of an accelerating universe this constant suddenly became one of the most important numbers in physics yet when physicists tried to calculate its value using quantum theory they arrived at a number 120 orders of magnitude 2 large it's one of the greatest mismatches in all of science a discrepancy so vast it's been dubbed the vacuum catastrophe some physicists suggest that dark energy isn't a constant at all but a dynamic evolving field something they call quintessence unlike a fixed cosmological constant quintessence could change over time subtly influencing the fate of the cosmos but for now these are just theories whispers in the dark together dark matter and dark energy paint a picture of a universe that is both Majestic and profoundly alien they remind us of how much we still don't understand that the cosmos is far stranger than our ancestors could have ever imagined and yet despite the mystery we can measure their effects we can see the gravitational pull of dark matter in the Way galaxies cluster together we can observe the cosmic expansion driven by dark energy in the red shift of distant light these invisible forces shape the universe sculpting galaxies dictating Cosmic Fates and setting the stage for everything we see but the story isn't over the search for Dark Matter particles continues in underground land Labs where detectors sit patiently waiting for a single elusive particle to leave its Mark astronomers peer deeper into space searching for the faintest clues about dark energy in the light of distant stars and galaxies in the end dark matter and dark energy remind us of a humbling truth the universe is not what it seems most of it exists Beyond the Veil of our senses in Realms of Darkness that we are only beginning to explore but perhaps the most profound question isn't what dark matter and dark energy are but why they exist at all why does the universe have this delicate balance a cosmic tug of war between invisible forces that hold it together and those that tear it apart maybe the answers are waiting for us in the depths of space in the hum of gravitational waves or in the quiet Stillness of a particle detector buried deep underground or maybe just maybe the universe will guard its Secrets a little longer for now we're left with this a cosmos dominated by Shadows by forces we cannot see but cannot ignore and in those Shadows hidden behind veils of mystery lies the key to understanding not just the universe but our place within it in the vast expanse of space amidst the silent dance of galaxies and the infinite stretch of the Void the universe holds its breath and somewhere in the flicker of Starlight and the hum of distant quazars the answers await waiting for us to notice the nature of dark flow the universe vast and unyielding stretches beyond our gaze into an endless ocean of stars and voids its scale defies comprehension its Secrets buried deep in Cosmic shadows and yet despite all we've uncovered there's one whisper from the COS OS that refuses to fade a faint but persistent pull like an invisible tide dragging entire clusters of galaxies in a single unyielding Direction this phenomenon is known as dark flow and it challenges not just our understanding of gravity but the very fabric of reality itself in the grand tapestry of the cosmos galaxies are not scattered randomly they flow they drift they fall towards gravitational Wells the invisible scaffolding of dark matter and Cosmic structures most of these motions can be explained by what we call the cosmic expansion driven by dark energy but in 2008 scientists examining data from NASA's Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe WAP stumbled upon something unexpected a subtle but measurable motion of Galaxy clusters all drifting in One Direction like leaves caught in a river current this wasn't supposed to happen according to our best models of the universe the distribution of galaxies at this scale should be random their movements dictated only by local gravitational influences and the gradual stretching of space itself yet here was evidence of something more something pulling entire regions of the observable universe towards an unknown destination the Discovery sent ripples through the scientific Community if dark flow was real it suggested something lurking Beyond The Cosmic Horizon something we cannot see cannot measure but can still feel imagine standing on the shore of a vast ocean watching the waves move not with the wind but towards a distant Point Beyond the Horizon you cannot see what's causing the waves but you know something is there something immense something hidden but let's pause for a moment how did we even measure this drift after all galaxies are unimaginably far away and their motions are influenced by countless gravitational tugs and Cosmic forces scientists turned to the sun zeldovich effect a subtle Distortion in the cosmic microwave background radiation caused by the hot gas within Galaxy clusters by measuring these tiny distortions astronomers could infer the motion of Galaxy clusters against the faint Afterglow of the Big Bang itself and the result was unmistakable clusters of galaxies spread across billions of light years were drifting in the same direction at incredible speeds up to 1,000 km per second a flow so vast so consistent that it couldn't be dismissed as statistical noise or observational error something massive something beyond our observable universe seemed to be pulling on these clusters with gravitational fingers we cannot see theories began to emerge some scientists proposed that dark flow might be caused by a colossal structure beyond the observable edge of the universe perhaps an unimaginably massive supercluster or even a remnant of a previous Universe bleeding into ours others speculated that it could be evidence of extra Dimensions with gravity leaking through the thin boundaries of our four-dimensional reality and then there was the most mindbending idea of all that dark flow might Point towards a Multiverse a collision between our universe and another hidden Beyond the Veil of cosmic expansion but here's where things get even stranger the universe as we understand it has a horizon a limit to what we can observe light can only travel so far in the finite age of the universe ierse and beyond that Horizon lies nothing we can see and yet dark flow suggests that this Horizon is not the edge of reality it's merely the edge of our perception this raises profound questions are we seeing the faint gravitational echo of something truly colossal beyond our Cosmic bubble is our universe just one droplet in an endless Cosmic sea each droplet influencing the next in unseen ways and if so what does that mean for our place in the cosmos are we passengers on a drifting ship carried Along by unseen Tides towards an unknowable destination not everyone agrees on dark flow follow-up studies using data from newer observatories like plank have questioned the strength of the evidence some scientists argue that what we're seeing might be an artifact an illusion caused by statistical noise or observational biases others remain convinced that the drift is real even if we cannot yet fully explain it but perhaps the greatest mystery of dark flow isn't whether it exists or not it's what it represents if real dark flow tells us that our universe is not isolated it is not a closed bubble of stars and galaxies drifting quietly into the void instead it suggests connections threads reaching beyond our universe tied to something larger something old older something we cannot yet comprehend think about this for a moment every Galaxy every Star every planet including our own is part of this motion we are not static observers in a fixed Cosmos we are participants in a grand Celestial current carried Along by forces older than time towards a destination hidden beyond the limits of light and space and maybe maybe we'll never know the answer maybe the source of dark flow will forever remain veiled behind the cosmic horizon or maybe one day new telescopes new experiments and new theories will allow us to peer just a little further to Glimpse what lies Beyond until then dark flow remains a riddle wrapped in gravity hidden in Shadows and etched into the motion of galaxies across billions of light years it's a reminder of how much we still don't know of how small we are and yet how profoundly connected we are to each other to the stars and to whatever weits Beyond the Edge of the universe in the end dark flow isn't just about clusters of galaxies drifting across the void it's about the pull we all feel the pull towards the unknown the unexplored the unanswered it's about the human drive to chase Horizons to to ask questions and to follow the faintest Whispers from the cosmos so we drift all of us together carried Along by currents we cannot see towards a destination we cannot know and Somewhere Beyond the Edge of light the universe holds its breath and waits the fifth force of nature somewhere in the labyrinthine depths of our universe hidden in the intricate dance of particles and forces there might be something more for centuries physicists have built a grand Cosmic stage supported by four fundamental forces gravity electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces together they dictate the behavior of everything from the swirling galaxies above us to the trembling atoms beneath our feet and yet despite their undeniable success in explaining so much of reality these four pillars of physics leave gaps questions unanswered phenomena unexplained could there be a fifth force of nature the search for this elusive fifth Force didn't begin with futuristic particle colliders or sophisticated computer simulations instead it began with something older gravity at the start of the 20th century Albert Einstein shattered our understanding of gravity with his theory of general relativity revealing it not as a force in the traditional sense but as the curvature of SpaceTime itself yet as powerful as Einstein's equations are they coexist uneasily with the smallest scales of the universe where quantum mechanics reign supreme in the quantum realm gravity seems almost out of place like an old Act trying to fit into a modern play physicists soon realize something troubling our best theories of the large general relativity and the small quantum mechanics simply refuse to speak the same language and in this silence this Chasm between the cosmic and the quantum The Whispers of a fifth Force began to emerge in 2015 deep within the walls of The atomy Institute in Hungary a team of physicists led by Tilla cror stumbled upon something extraordinary while studying the decay of an excited burum 8 nucleus they observed an unexpected anomaly a tiny blip in the data suggesting the presence of a new particle this particle if real could be evidence of something revolutionary a force carrying Bon potentially associated with a fifth fundamental Force they named it the X17 particle a hypothetical bosson with a mass of about 17 Mega electron volts its existence if confirmed could imply an entirely new force a force that subtly influences matter in ways we've never observed before but skepticism runs deep in science an extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence if the X17 particle represents a fifth Force what kind of force would it be some physicists suggest it might act like a bridge between the known and the UN known a dark force interacting primarily with dark matter that mysterious invisible substance that makes up about 85% of the universe's mass in this scenario the fifth Force wouldn't just change our understanding of the atomic World it could illuminate one of the darkest corners of cosmology but the implications stretch even further a fifth Force might explain anomalies in Galaxy rotation curves strange discrepancies in gravitational lenses or even the subtle drift of cosmic expansion it might unify seemingly disconnected threads of physics stitching together a more complete tapestry of reality yet the search for this force is fraught with challenges the anomaly observed at atom key has yet to be independently confirmed and the particle itself remains stubbornly elusive other experiments using tools like the Large Hadron Collider or Precision atomic clocks are on the hunt scanning the the subatomic world for traces of this ghostly Force so far they' found nothing conclusive but science thrives on the edge of the unknown the history of physics is littered with ideas that once seemed outlandish the curvature of SpaceTime the uncertainty principle the wave particle duality of light each Discovery began with an anomaly a faint signal Whispering from the depths of data inviting scientists to lean closer to question to doubt and to explore if a fifth Force truly exists it could rewrite the fundamental laws of nature it might require new mathematics new experiments and perhaps even a new way of thinking about reality itself but perhaps more importantly it would remind us of something essential that the universe is still hiding secrets in plain sight waiting for us to notice for now the fifth Force remains an open question a tantalizing mystery at the edge of science somewhere in the flickering glow of particle collisions or the distant dance of galaxies the answer Waits and whether it reveals itself tomorrow a decade from now or centuries in the future one thing is certain the universe has not finished surprising us it never does the holograph graic principle imagine for a moment that everything you know the Stars the galaxies the planets even yourself isn't quite what it seems that the Universe in all its infinite Beauty and complexity might not be a three-dimensional expanse stretching into Infinity but instead something far stranger something flat a two-dimensional canvas upon which reality itself is merely projected like light shining through film onto a theater screen this isn't science fiction this is the holographic principle one of the most profound and mind-bending ideas ever conceived in theoretical physics it's a concept that sits at the intersection of black holes string theory and the Very fabric of space and time and it all starts with an unsettling realization about information and the strange behavior of black holes but let's not get ahead of ourselves to understand how physicists stumbled upon this principle we need to start at the edge of a black hole in 1974 physicist Steven Hawking made a groundbreaking discovery he showed that black holes aren't entirely black they emit faint radiation now known as Hawking radiation over time this radiation causes the black hole to shrink and eventually evaporate entirely but this discovery brought with it a troubling Paradox what happens to the information contained within everything that falls into a black hole in our universe information isn't supposed to disappear if you burn a book its Pages might turn to Ash but the information the words the ink the arrangement of letters isn't truly destroyed in principle you could piece it all back together from the smoke heat and Ash if you had enough knowledge and computing power this idea is deeply embedded in the laws of physics information cannot be lost and yet if a black hole evaporates completely where does all that information go this puzzle is known as the black hole information Paradox and for decades it haunted physicists among them was Gerard t hft a Dutch theoretical physicist who would go on to win the Nobel Prize in the 1990s it hoof proposed something radical maybe the information that enters a black hole isn't lost maybe it's stored on the Event Horizon the boundary of the black hole itself imagine a three-dimensional object falling into a black hole its information instead of Vanishing into the singularity gets encoded on the surface of the Event Horizon like a shadow projected onto a wall this realization was profound it suggested that everything happening inside the black hole could in principle be described by data imprinted on its two-dimensional surface but what if this wasn't just true for black holes what if it was true for the entire universe enter Leonard suskind a theoretical physicist who expanded on T Hof's idea suskin proposed that the universe itself might operate under a similar principle everything we perceive in three dimensions might actually be encoded on a distant two-dimensional boundary a cosmic Horizon at the edge of our obser able Universe to put it simply our three-dimensional reality might be a hologram now before your mind starts spinning into existential dread let's clarify what this means the holographic principle doesn't suggest that the universe is fake or an illusion like in The Matrix instead it proposes that the fundamental description of reality might be simpler than it appears that the vast seemingly boundless Cosmos can be described entirely by information encoded on a two-dimensional surface but how could this possibly work how can a two-dimensional surface describe a three-dimensional Universe think about a holographic image on the surface of a flat two-dimensional sheet you can store information that creates the illusion of three dimensions walk around a hologram and you can see depth perspective even movement the image isn't in the sheet it's projected from it in a similar way the holographic principle suggests that our experience of three-dimensional space the feeling of depth distance and motion might be an emergent property of a deeper two-dimensional reality at this point the principle becomes more than just a curiosity it becomes a powerful mathematical tool in 1997 physicist Juan Mal Cena proposed a groundbreaking Theory known as the ads CFT correspondence it provided a concrete example of the holographic principle in action showing that a universe described by gravitational forces in three dimensions could be mathematically equivalent to a universe described by quantum mechanics in two dimensions in other words gravity and quantum mechanics two seemingly incompatible theories might actually be two sides of the same holographic coin this realization sent shock waves through theoretical physics suddenly the holographic principle wasn't just an abstract idea it was a framework a lens through which physicists could attempt to unify the two great pillars of modern science Einstein's general relativity and quantum mechanics but here's where things get even stranger if the universe is indeed holographic it raises profound philosophical questions what does it mean to exist in a universe where space and time might not be fundamental where everything we see feel and experience is at its core just information encoded on a distant boundary it also suggests something deeply unsettling about reality itself if the universe is fundamentally two-dimensional then space and time the very stage upon which all of existence plays out might not be as solid as we think they might be emergent properties like the shimmering surface of a pond hiding a far deeper reality beneath for now the holographic principle remains a theory a tantalizing clue in the search for a Theory of Everything But experiments like those conducted at the firmalab holer are actively trying to find evidence for this holographic nature of reality scientists are searching for tiny jittering fluctuations in SpaceTime the pixels of our our Cosmic screen whether or not these experiments succeed the holographic principle has already changed how we think about the universe it's shown us that the line between Dimensions between space and information might not be as clear as we once believed it's a reminder that reality no matter how familiar it feels still holds secrets so strange they seem pulled from science fiction so the next time you look up at the night sky filled with distant stars and galaxies scattered across unimaginable distances remember this it's possible that everything you see magnetic monopoles magnetic fields are everywhere they guide migrating birds across continents they shape the glowing auroras dancing in our skies and they wrap around stars and galaxies like invisible threads but there's something strange about them something deeply asymmetrical every magnet has two poles a north and a South break one in half and you won't get a single North or South Pole you'll just have two smaller magnets each with their own pair of poles no matter how small you cut it the poles remain Inseparable And yet when physicists write down the mathematical laws of magnetism there's nothing absolutely nothing that forbids the existence of a single isolated magnetic pole a magnetic monopole it's as if the universe is holding on to a secret a single missing piece in the grand puzzle of fundamental forces if magnetic monopoles exist they wouldn't just solve an academic curiosity they would unlock answers to some of the deepest questions about the nature of reality and yet despite nearly a century of searching we haven't found one not not yet The Story begins in the 19th century with James Clark Maxwell one of the greatest physicists who ever lived Maxwell's equations unified electricity and magnetism into a single elegant Theory they revealed that electric charges like electrons or protons can exist on their own a single electron carries a negative charge a single proton carries a positive charge but mag magets they seemed different Maxwell's math showed that magnetic poles must always come in pairs North and South locked together forever but then in 1931 Paul der a quiet deeply introspective physicist noticed something strange while exploring the mathematics of quantum mechanics dra discovered that if even a single magnetic monopole existed anywhere in the universe it would explain one of the biggest mysteries in physics why electric charge is always quantized why every electron carries the exact same tiny charge and why every proton perfectly balances it Drax Insight was breathtaking a single magnetic monopole hiding somewhere in the cosmos could explain a property shared by every charged particle in existence it was as if the universe had written its deepest rules in invisible ink and dra had caught a glimpse of the message but there was a problem no one had ever seen a magnetic monopole and physics for all its beauty is still a science it demands evidence decades passed in the 1970s theoretical physicists like Gerard tahou and Alexander polyakov showed that magnetic monopoles weren't just mathematical Curiosities they were an inevitable prediction of grand unified theories attempts to combine the electromagnetic weak and strong nuclear forces into one overarching framework according to their equations magnetic monopol could have been borne in the furnace of the Big Bang forged in the chaotic moments when the universe was still a molten sea of particles and forces but if monopol were created in those fiery first moments where are they now one possibility is that they're incredibly rare so rare that they've drifted apart across the expanding Cosmos each one separated by unimaginable distances another possibility is that they're heavy so heavy that our most advanced particle accelerators can't hope to create them some estimates suggest a single magnetic monopo could be billions of times more massive than a proton if one passed through the Earth it would leave behind an almost imperceptible magnetic fingerprint a ghostly Trail across our detectors but then something happened on February 14th 1982 physicist Blas Cabrera was running an experiment using a superconducting loop a ring of wire cooled to near absolute zero designed to detect the faint magnetic signal of a passing monopole and on that Valentine's Day the detector blinked just once a perfect single blip exactly the kind of signal you'd expect from a magnetic monopole passing through it was electrifying for a brief moment it seemed like physics had caught a glimpse of something extraordinary but the signal was never repeated other detectors other experiments silence Cabrera's result remains one of the great anomalies in science a fleeting Whisper of something Incredible or just a glitch a cruel trick played by the noise in the machine today the search continues scientists have built vast arrays of detectors buried deep underground or spread across Frozen Landscapes all hoping to catch that unmistakable signature some have turned their eyes to the Stars wondering if magnetic monopoles might be trapped in the dense cores of neutron stars or lingering in the fiery remnants of supernova there's even speculation about monopole stars hypothetical celestial objects where magnetic charge dominates warping space and time around them and yet despite all our efforts the universe remains stubbornly quiet no monopol have revealed themselves but here's the thing if they do exist if these particles are real they could change everything they might explain the strange symmetry between electricity and magnetism they could offer clues about the unification of forces or about the earliest moments of the universe when space and time were still settling into their current form they might even tell us something about dark matter that invisible glue binding galaxies together it's a strange thought that somewhere out there drifting silently through the cosmic void could be a single magnetic monopole a lone traveler carrying with it answers to some of the oldest questions we've ever asked for now our detectors hum quietly in the dark our equation weight patiently on chalkboards and in journals and every so often a physicist pauses to wonder if the universe is hiding its Secrets just Out Of Reach or if the answer is already staring Us in the face buried in the noise of the data waiting for someone to notice if a single magnetic monopole exists it might already be on its way hurtling through Interstellar space across billions of light years passing through stars and planets and comets carrying with it a secret older than the universe itself and maybe just maybe one day it will pass through one of our detectors and when it does the universe will finally answer one of its oldest questions not with a whisper but with a single perfect magnetic blip super symmetry in the hidden architecture of reality where particles dance and forces weave the fabric of existence physicists have long searched for something profound something that would bring order to the chaos Simplicity to the complexity and balance to the universe's most fundamental equations they've given this elusive idea a name super symmetry at first glance the universe appears wildly asymmetrical matter dominates over antimatter galaxies spin with puzzling speeds hinting at invisible dark matter and the fundamental forces seem like mismatched puzzle pieces awkwardly squeezed together but beneath this apparent mess physicists suspect there might be a deeper Harmony a hidden symmetry connecting every particle in existence to understand why super symmetry is such an alluring idea we need to start with the standard model of particle physics it's the most successful scientific theory ever devised to explain the universe at its smallest scales the standard model tells us about quarks the building blocks of of protons and neutrons leptons like electrons and neutrinos and the force carrying particles such as photons gluons and the w and z bosons and then there's the higs boson the Keystone of the entire structure responsible for giving Mass to everything but despite its triumphs the standard model has cracks in its foundation for one it doesn't explain Dark Matter the mysterious invisible substance that makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe it also doesn't account for Gravity the force that holds planets in orbit keeps stars burning and sculpts the Universe on a cosmic scale and strangest of all it predicts a universe balanced on a Razor's Edge with parameters so finely tuned that even a slight deviation would render reality unrecognizable this is where super symmetry enters the stage the core idea of super symmetry is breathtaking in its Elegance it proposes that every fundamental particle we know has a super partner a hidden twin with slightly different properties fermans like quarks and electrons which make up matter would have bonic super partners and bosons the particles that carry forces would have fermionic super Partners the these super Partners even have names quarks would have squarks electrons would have selectron and photons would have phinos at first this might sound like a Particle physicist's Fever dream doubling the zoo of particles we already know but super symmetry isn't just about creating more particles it's about creating balance the interactions between particles and their super Partners would elegantly cancel out certain Infinities that plague the equations of the standard model without super symmetry the higs boson mass for example would spiral into absurdly high values breaking the mathematical consistency of the theory with super symmetry those Infinities vanish and the equations regain their symmetry but perhaps the most exciting implication of super symmetry is its connection to dark matter if super Partners exist one of of them a stable electrically neutral particle called the neutralino could be the elusive Dark Matter particle scientists have been hunting for decades if super symmetry is real dark matter isn't some abstract mystery it's a real physical particle drifting silently through the vastness of space binding galaxies together with its invisible gravity but there's a problem despite Decades of searching we've never seen a single super partner the Large Hadron Collider Humanity's most powerful particle accelerator was supposed to be the key when it was switched on in 2008 scientists hoped it would smash protons together with enough energy to reveal the faint signatures of super symmetric particles but Collision after Collision data set after data set nothing the super Partners remain hidden if they exist at all this sence has led to a quiet existential crisis in physics super symmetry is beautiful mathematically consistent and capable of solving some of the universe's most pressing puzzles but science doesn't care about beauty it cares about evidence and so far evidence has been stubbornly absent some physicists have adjusted their expectations maybe super partners aren't as light as we thought maybe they require even higher energies to reveal themselves others suggest that super symmetry might not be a universal symmetry it could be broken like a shattered mirror whose pieces still reflect an underlying pattern and still others are beginning to wonder if super symmetry despite its Elegance might simply be wrong but here's the thing about physics history has shown us time and time again that nature often hides its secrets well the higs boss itself was predicted decades before it was finally discovered in 2012 neutrinos were once thought impossible to detect and now we observe them routinely the universe it seems enjoys keeping physicists on their toes and even if super symmetry turns out to be incorrect it has already left its Mark the search for these hidden particles has pushed our understanding of high energy physics to its limits it has driven the creation of new technologies new experiments and new ways of thinking about the universe but what if super symmetry is real what if deep within the data collected at the Large Hadron Collider a faint signal is waiting a signature of a squark A slepton or a fatino what if Dark Matter isn't some esoteric puzzle but a sea of invisible super symmetric particles passing through us every second without a sound the stakes are enormous if super symmetry is discovered it won't just be another footnote in a physics textbook it will be a revolution it will mean that the Universe isn't chaotic or fragmented but deeply fundamentally symmetrical it will mean that dark matter isn't just a theoretical placeholder but a real and measurable aspect of our reality right now experiments continue particle accelerators hum beneath the Earth detectors stare into the Silence of the cosmos and physicists wait hoping for a signal a flash of insight that could reveal the hidden symmetry beneath it all super symmetry might be out there just beyond the edge of our current understanding waiting for us to look a little closer dig a little deeper and dream a little bigger and if it's real if this symmetry exists it won't just change our understanding of particles or forces is it will change our understanding of everything a cosmic truth hidden in the smallest building blocks of reality waiting patiently to be found universe's existence why is there something rather than nothing it's a question so fundamental so colossal that it feels almost impossible to answer but it's also a question that Whispers to us from the depths of our minds when we stare into the night sky every Galaxy every Star every fleeting particle of light all of it exists and the sheer fact that anything exists at all might just be the most profound mystery of all at its core the question challenges everything we know about reality if the universe is governed by physical laws where did those laws come from if the Big Bang marked the beginning of time and space what came before and why did the universe emerge in such a way that it allowed matter galaxies planets and ultimately us to even begin approaching this question we must start with what we know the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago the universe exploded into existence from an unimaginably hot and dense singularity in those first moments space and time unfurled energy transformed into matter and the building blocks of everything began to emerge but what triggered this event was it a random fluctuation in a Quantum field was it a cosmic inevitability bound to happen given infinite time or was it something we can't even begin to comprehend physicists often point to The Strange World of quantum mechanics for possible answers in the quantum realm particles can pop in and out of existence seemingly without cause empty space isn't truly empty it sees with fleeting particles and antiparticles winking into being and then annihilating each other could it be that our universe emerged from such a Quantum fluctuation a brief moment of instability in the nothingness this idea suggests that nothing might not actually be nothing instead it might be a Restless sea of potential brimming with the possibility of universes emerging like bubbles in a cosmic foam but even if this is true we're still left with with the same question why does this Quantum nothingness exist at all some scientists turn to the Multiverse theory for answers in this framework our universe is just one of countless others each with its own physical laws constants and conditions perhaps universes are born all the time and we simply live in one where the conditions were just right for matter to Clump together into galaxies stars and life but this too feels like a kind of cosmic deflection why does the Multiverse exist why is there anything at all the philosopher gotfried velm lietz famously asked this question in the 18th century and his answer remains one of the most poetic he suggested that the Universe exists because it is the best of all possible worlds a creation born from some intrinsic principle of perfection this view has echoed in modern theoretical physics where some scientists suggest that the universe's laws are finely tuned because in some way they had to be it's not necessarily design but rather an inevitability a mathematical truth woven into the fabric of reality but there's another possibility one that's deeply unsettling what if the question itself is flawed what if asking why the universe exists is like asking what's north of the the North Pole some physicists suggest that causality the idea that every effect has a cause might not apply to the origin of the universe time space and cause effect relationships all began with a big bang to ask what came before might be meaningless because before didn't exist yet even with this perspective we're still haunted by the mystery because behind every scientific answer every elegant equation there lies a deeper question why these laws of physics and not others why this universe and not nothing perhaps we'll never have an answer perhaps the existence of the universe is an unanswerable question a cosmic Enigma forever beyond our reach but in some ways isn't that fitting the fact that we as self-aware clusters of atoms can even ask such a question is astonishing in itself our minds products of Stardust and evolution have reached out across time and space to confront the very mystery of existence and maybe just maybe the question is the answer the universe exists so that questions like this can be asked so that Consciousness can gaze outward and Inward and Marvel at the improbable beauty of it all so why does the universe exist for now it Remains the grandest question of the them all a mystery written across the Stars carried in the hum of atoms and reflected in every fleeting moment of Our Lives black hole Singularity the edges of understanding where light itself bends into silence and the known laws of physics collapse under their own weight lies a boundary a place both feared and revered by scientists it's the Event Horizon of a black hole a cosmic curtain Beyond which reality dissolves into something incomprehensible but what lies beyond that curtain what happens deep within the black hole at its very core the answer or perhaps the lack of one brings us face to face with one of the greatest enigmas of the universe The Singularity the term Singularity evokes images of infinite density unimaginable gravity and a breakdown of everything we know about space time and matter a place where the equations that describe our universe the very same equations that let us predict the motion of planets and the behavior of stars simply stop working to understand how we got here we need to step back to 1915 when a man with wild hair and piercing eyes scribbled down an equation that would change our understanding of gravity forever Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity told us that gravity isn't just a force pulling objects together it's the curvature of SpaceTime itself sculpted by the mass and energy of celestial bodies planets orbit Stars not because they're being pulled by some Invisible Thread but because the star's immense Mass creates a dent in the fabric of space and the planet follows that curve but Einstein's theory also hinted at something far stranger if enough mass is packed into a small enough space SpaceTime would curve so dramatically that it would fold in on itself for forming a black hole a region from which nothing not even light can escape at the heart of this gravitational monster lies The Singularity according to Einstein's equations The Singularity is a point of infinite density and zero volume a place where all the mass of the collapsing star is compressed into an infinitesimal point but here's the problem Infinity isn't something physics can handle very well it's like dividing by zero it's not an answer it's an error message The Singularity is where our theories break down where the map ends and the terrain becomes unknowable and yet despite its unknowability The Singularity isn't just a mathematical curiosity it's a real physical consequence of our best theories of gravity but here's where the story takes a sharp turn into the realm of paradox you see if singularities truly exist they pose a problem a problem so disturbing that physicists gave it a name the cosmic censorship hypothesis this idea was proposed by the brilliant physicist Roger Penrose in 1969 Penrose asked a deceptively simple question could naked singularities exist let me explain in a typical black hole The Singularity is safely hidden behind the Event Horizon that invisible boundary surrounding the black hole anything that crosses the Event Horizon is forever trapped and no information about what happens inside can escape in a sense The Event Horizon acts as a cosmic sensor hiding the singularity from View and preventing its chaos from spilling into the rest of the universe but what if under certain conditions a singularity could form without an event horizon what if it were exposed raw unfiltered and visible to the universe such a naked Singularity would mean that the deepest secrets of SpaceTime the breakdown of physics itself would be laid bare for all to see the laws of cause and effect could unravel and our understanding of the universe might fall apart entirely penrose's Cosmic censorship hypothesis proposes that nature abhor this kind of chaos that every singularity must be cloaked behind an event horizon hidden from the rest of the cosmos in essence the universe has a self-correcting mechanism to prevent us from peering into its most chaotic and incomprehensible depths but is this hypothesis true for decades physicists have wrestled with this question mathematical models suggest that under certain exotic conditions like highly spinning black holes or specific types of gravitational collapse naked singularities might form in fact some numerical simulations hint that Cosmic censorship could be violated if a naked Singularity exists it would be more than just a curiosity it would be a crack in the foundation of our understanding it would mean that the universe doesn't always play by the rules we expect but there's another layer to this mystery if singularities are where Einstein's equations fail could they also be Windows into a deep a theory of gravity one that unites Einstein's general relativity with the quantum mechanics governing the tiniest particles in the universe physicists have long believed that a theory of quantum gravity something like string theory or Loop quantum gravity might smooth out the Infinities of the singularity replacing the impossible point of infinite density with something more physically meaningful but for now the singularity remains hidden and Cosmic sensorship remains unproven black holes continue to act as Cosmic safes locking away their secrets behind event Horizons daring us to figure out how to pick the lock in recent years advancements in observational astronomy have brought us closer to these mysterious Giants The Event Horizon telescope captured the first ever image of a black holes Event Horizon in the Galaxy m87 a glowing ring of light encircling the shadow of something un unspeakably dense but even this Monumental achievement is only the beginning future telescopes and observatories may allow us to probe the fringes of these Cosmic voids inching closer to answers about what lies at their heart but here's the thing the singularity whether hidden or exposed isn't just a problem for physicists it's a problem for us it's a reminder that there are places where our understanding breaks down where reality stops making sense and where the universe seems to whisper you weren't meant to see this yet we can't stop looking because every time we confront the singularity every time we challenge the limits of physics and peer into the mathematical Abyss we inch closer to something profound something about the nature of space time and perhaps even existence itself are singularities truly hidden behind Cosmic veils for for ever Out Of Reach or will we one day find ourselves staring directly into the raw unfiltered chaos at the heart of a naked Singularity witnessing the universe laid bare in all its incomprehensible glory for now the singularity Remains the ultimate mystery an enigma carved into the heart of gravity hidden in the darkest corners of SpaceTime and as long as it exists as long as that quiet question hangs in the cosmic void Humanity will continue to search to calculate and to dream hoping that one day we'll finally understand what lies Beyond the Edge of the universe's Greatest Secret vacuum catastrophe in the vast emptiness of space where stars are scattered like distant lanterns and galaxies drift in the slow dance of cosmic time there exists something that defies intuition something so counterintuitive that it has left physic ists scratching their heads for decades it's not a star or a planet not a black hole or a nebula no it's the emptiness itself the vacuum of space and it holds within it one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics this Enigma is known as the vacuum catastrophe or more formally the cosmological constant problem it's a paradox so profound that it challenges our very understanding of reality to understand this problem we must first ask a deceptively simple question what is nothing it seems like a straightforward concept nothing is the absence of something a void an emptiness but in physics nothingness is anything but simple according to Quantum field Theory even the most perfect vacuum a space completely devoid of matter and energy is not truly empty it's a SE ocean of activity a bubbling froth of virtual particles popping in and out of existence particles and antiparticles spontaneously appear Collide and annihilate in a ceaseless Quantum dance leaving behind fleeting imprints on the vacuum itself these virtual particles aren't just theoretical they have measurable effects the Casmir effect for instance demonstrates that two uncharged metal plates placed very close together in a vacuum will feel a tiny attraction Ive Force pulling them together this isn't because of some mysterious energy between them but because the plates are altering the quantum froth of the vacuum creating an imbalance of virtual particles if empty space is in fact not empty then it must have energy a background hum a fundamental Baseline physicists call this the vacuum energy and this energy strange as it sounds has consequences on a grand Cosmic scale in 1917 Albert Einstein in his his attempt to describe the universe as a static unchanging entity introduced a term into his equations the cosmological constant this constant represented a repulsive Force embedded in the fabric of space itself counteracting gravity to keep the universe from collapsing in on itself Einstein later called it his greatest blunder after Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe wasn't static it was expanding and yet decades later the mological constant would return this time as an answer to a far stranger mystery in the late 1990s two independent teams of astronomers studying distant supern noi made a shocking Discovery the universe isn't just expanding it's accelerating galaxies are not only drifting apart but are doing so faster and faster with time this discovery turned cosmology on its head something some invisible force was pushing the universe apart a mysterious pressure embedded in the vacuum of space scientists resurrected Einstein's cosmological constant to explain it now rebranded as dark energy but here's where the Paradox begins physicists turned to Quantum field Theory to calculate the vacuum energy the energy of empty space the result was staggering theoretical predictions suggested that the energy of the vacuum should be 120 orders of magnitude larger than what we actually observe that's a number so incomprehensibly vast that it's equivalent to comparing the size of an atom to the size of the observable universe in other words the vacuum energy predicted by quantum mechanics and the vacuum energy implied by The observed expansion of the universe are wildly catastrophically different this mismatch is what we call the vacuum catastrophe arguably the biggest numerical discrepancy in all of science how could two of our most successful theories quantum mechanics and general relativity disagree so violently this isn't just a math problem it's a crack in the foundation of our understanding if the vacuum energy were even slightly different if it were just a bit stronger or weaker the universe as we know it wouldn't exist galaxies wouldn't have formed Stars wouldn't have ignited and life would never have emerged it seems as though the vacuum energy has been fine-tuned to an almost impossible degree a cosmic coincidence that borders on the miraculous physicists have proposed many explanations one idea suggests that our universe might not be the only one perhaps we live in a Multiverse where countless universes are born with different vacuum energies in most of them the vacuum energy might be catastrophically high ripping matter apart before anything can form but in our universe by sheer statistical luck the vacuum energy happens to be just right others suggest that we might be missing something fundamental a deeper Theory of physics that unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity smoothing out the mathematical inconsistencies and revealing a hidden order beneath the chaos some physicists turn to string theory hoping its complex web of vibrating strings and extra Dimensions might hold the key to resolving the Paradox but the vacuum catastrophe remains unsolved it's as if the universe is holding up a mirror to our ignorance reflecting back our incomplete understanding of the most fundamental aspects of reality and yet it's also a reminder of something beautiful that even the void even the nothingness of empty space is Rich with mystery and possibility you might be wondering does this Paradox have practical implications or is it just an abstract puzzle for theoretical physicists to lose sleepover the answer is both if we can understand the vacuum energy if we can unlock the secret of the cosmological constant we might not only resolve one of the greatest puzzles in physics but also Glimpse the deepest workings of the universe itself could understanding the vacuum energy lead to new technologies to harnessing the fundamental energies of SpaceTime could it reveal insights about the ultimate fate of our Cosmos will the universe expand forever grow cold and Fade Into Eternal Darkness or will something even stranger happen driven by the Unseen forces lurking in the vacuum for now the vacuum remains both a void and a paradox a whispering silence filled with secrets we can barely comprehend it reminds us that the universe is not merely stars and galaxies it's also the invisible fabric between them the spaces where nothing should exist yet everything begins perhaps the answer to the vacuum catastrophe lies in equations yet to be written or in observations waiting to be made by future telescopes scanning the night sky until then every time we look into the void we are reminded of the profound mystery that resides not in what we see but in the spaces in between in those silent gaps in the shimmering nothingness the universe hides one of its greatest secrets and somewhere out there or perhaps within us the answer is waiting to be found fine-tuning problem at first glance the universe seems vast chaotic and indifferent galaxies Collide stars explode and black holes silently consume whatever Ventures too close but beneath this Grand spectacle lies something far stranger a hidden order a set of cosmic dials tuned with unimaginable Precision if these dials were adjusted even slightly by the tiniest fraction the universe as we know it wouldn't exist no galaxies no stars no planets and certainly no us this is the fine-tuning problem one of the most perplexing mysteries in modern physics and cosmology why does our universe seem so perfectly set up for life is it coincidence necessity or something deeper to understand the fine tuning problem we must first confront a profound truth the laws of physics are not arbitrary they are mathematical elegant and astonishingly precise they govern everything from the fusion of hydrogen atoms in the heart of a star to the dance of electrons in a molecule of water but these laws don't exist in isolation they depend on a set of fundamental constants numbers that appear in the equations of Nature and determine how the universe behaves take the gravitational constant for example it determines the strength of gravity the force that binds stars planets and galaxies together if gravity were just a little bit stronger Stars would burn through their fuel too quickly collapsing into black holes before planets or life could ever form if it were weak Stars might never ignite at all and the universe would remain a cold dark expanse of scattered hydrogen or consider the strong nuclear force which holds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei if this force was slightly weaker atoms heavier than hydrogen wouldn't form there would be no carbon no oxygen none of the building blocks of life and then there's the cosmological constant the mysterious energy that drives the accelerated expansion of the universe its value is so unfathomably small yet so precisely tuned that even a tiny deviation would have caused the universe to either collapse back in on itself or expand so rapidly that galaxies and stars could never form each of these constants is like a dial on an impossibly complex control panel and somehow every single one is set just right change any dial by even a hair's breadth and the universe becomes sterile lifeless or non-existent this level of precision raises an unsettling question why is this fine-tuning just a fluke a one Ina quadrillion chance or is there something deeper at play scientists philosophers and theologians have all grappled with this question and their answers range from the mathematical to the metaphysical one explanation is the anthropic principle it suggests that we shouldn't be surprised to find ourselves in a universe that supports life because if the universe weren't fine-tuned we wouldn't be here to ask the question in the first place in other words the very fact that we're here means the universe must have the right conditions for life but while the anthropic principle is logically sound it feels unsatisfying it doesn't explain why the dials are set the way they are it simply shrugs and says well if they weren't we wouldn't be here another idea is the Multiverse hypothesis what if our universe isn't the only one what if there are countless universes each with its own set of physical laws and constants in most of these universes the dials are set randomly and the result is chaos sterility or instant collapse but in an infinite sea of universes there will inevitably be some perhaps very few where the conditions are just right and we of course exist in one of those lucky universes it's an elegant idea but there's a problem we have no direct evidence for the Multiverse it's an idea that sits at the very edge of science balancing precariously between Theory and speculation yet it remains one of the most popular explanations for fine-tuning among physicist ists then there's another possibility one that feels almost poetic what if the fine-tuning of the universe isn't just an accident but a fundamental aspect of reality what if the constants of nature are not random at all but inevitable woven into the deep mathematical fabric of existence in this view the universe couldn't not be fine-tuned because these constants emerge naturally from some deeper principle some elegant equation we have yet to discover this idea suggests that our universe isn't a lucky accident it's the inevitable outcome of a deeper law a cosmic symmetry waiting to be revealed but perhaps the most unsettling possibility is that we might never know that the fine tuning of the universe could remain an eternal mystery a riddle whispered in the void between Stars forever beyond our reach what's undeniable is this we exist on a Razor's Edge every breath we take every star that shines every moment of existence depends on the delicate balance of these Cosmic dials it's a reminder of how fragile and improbable our universe truly is a Symphony played on the strings of mathematics with each note perfectly tuned and yet here we are thinking wondering and asking questions about our own existence some somewhere buried in the equations of physics or hidden in the glow of distant galaxies the answer might already be waiting whether it's found in the hum of quantum Fields the vastness of a Multiverse or the Elegance of an Undiscovered law of nature the fine-tuning problem challenges us to confront something deeply humbling that the universe is not just a chaotic accident but a place of Exquisite almost impossible Precision for now we can only Marvel at the balance at the knife edge on which reality rests at the dials perfectly set as if the universe itself were holding its breath waiting for us to notice in the grand expanse of time and space amidst the glow of stars and the Silence of the Void we find ourselves balanced between knowledge and mystery the fine tuning of the cosmos isn't just a scientific puzzle it's a reminder of how rare how fleeting and how precious this existence truly is and maybe just maybe the universe fine-tuned itself so that one day somewhere on a pale blue dot circling an ordinary star we would exist to notice Quantum measurement problem in the invisible world of the very small where particles flicker in and out of existence where probability rules over certainty and where reality itself seems to play dice there lies a question so perplexing so fundamental that that it challenges our deepest assumptions about what it means to observe the universe it's called the quantum measurement problem and it isn't just a technical issue for physicists it's a philosophical puzzle that cuts to the core of reality itself at the heart of this mystery lies an idea so bizarre so counterintuitive that it has baffled scientists and philosophers for over a century to understand it we must step into the Strange World of quantum mechanics a theory that describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales where electrons orbit atoms photons dance through space and the classical rules of physics collapse into a haze of probabilities in the early 20th century physicists like Neil bore verer Heisenberg and Irvin shringer discovered something extraordinary particles at the quantum level don't behave like tiny billiard balls bouncing predictably through space instead they exist as probability waves mathematical clouds of potential outcomes an electron for instance doesn't have a definite position or velocity until we measure it before that it exists in a superp position a state where it's everywhere and nowhere at the same time it's not just a theoretical Oddity it's something we've observed in the lab take the famous double slit experiment when scientists fired individual electrons at a barrier with two narrow slits they expected the particles to pass through one slit or the other and create two distinct patterns on the wall behind it but instead they saw an interference pattern as if each electron was behaving like a wave and passing through both slits simultaneously but here's where things get really strange when scientists placed a detector near the slits to see which slit each electron passed through the interference pattern disappeared the electrons stopped behaving like waves and started behaving like particles choosing one slit or the other it was as if the act of observation itself forced the electron to make up its mind and this is the Crux of the quantum measurement problem how does the act of measuring or observing a Quantum system cause it to collapse from a wave of probabilities into a single definite outcome what is observation in this context is it the act of a conscious mind looking at the system is it the interaction with a measuring device or is there something deeper at play something woven into the very fabric of reality to make sense of this puzzle physicists have proposed various interpretations each one more thought-provoking than the last one of the earliest is the Copenhagen interpretation championed by Neils bour and Vera Heisenberg according to this view Quantum systems don't have definite properties until they're measured the way cave function the mathematical description of a Quantum State represents all possible outcomes until measurement forces one possibility to crystallize into reality but this raises an uncomfortable question what counts as a measurement is it a human mind a machine or simply any interaction with the environment in 1935 Irving Schrodinger highlighted the absurdity of this interpretation with his now famous thought experiment Schrodinger's cat imagine a cat sealed in a box with a vial of poison that will be released if a radioactive atom decays a Quantum event governed by probability according to the Copenhagen interpretation until we open the box and observe the cat it exists in a superos both alive and dead at the same time it's an unsettling image but it captures the essence of the problem how does the blurry uncertainty of the quantum World resolve into the sharp definite reality we experience then there's the many world's interpretation proposed by Hugh Everett III in the 1950s this idea suggests that every time a Quantum measurement is made the universe splits into multiple parallel realities one for each possible outcome in one universe shring as cat is alive in another it's dead according to this view the wave function never truly collapses it simply branches into an infinite Multiverse it's an elegant solution but it comes at the cost of introducing countless unseen universes each carrying its own version of reality other interpretations like the pilot wave theory or the quantum decoherence theory attempt to sidestep the measurement problem in different ways decoherence for example suggests that interactions with the surrounding environment lock Quantum systems into definite States removing the need for an observer but even this explanation raises new questions about the nature of measurement and reality at its core the quantum measurement problem isn't just about electrons slits or mathematical equations it's about the boundary between the quantum world and the classical world the blurry line between probability and certainty between potential and actuality and somewhere along that boundary lies the answer to one of the deepest questions in science what is reality made of the implications of this puzzle go beyond physics they touch on philosophy on Consciousness on the very Act of perception itself when you look at the stars in the night sky are you collapsing their Quantum States into definite positions are you in some profound way participating in the creation of the universe just by observing it for now the quantum measurement problem remains unsolved but every time a physicist fires electrons through slits every time a quantum computer manipulates entangled particles every time we probe the fabric of SpaceTime for answers we Edge closer to the truth perhaps the universe itself is a kind of grand Quantum experiment a cosmic double slit test waiting for someone somewhere to observe it or perhaps the answers lie not in the stars or the atoms but in the space between them in the fragile Act of measurement where the infinite possibilities of the quantum World collapse into the fleeting fleeting certainty of now one day we may understand why observation changes reality why particles choose paths and whether the universe branches into infinite possibilities or simply shrugs and resolves itself into one until then the quantum measurement problem stands as a reminder that at the smallest scale of reality certainty is an illusion and knowledge is always just beyond our grasp but isn't that the most beautiful mystery of all that somewhere in the shimmering Haze of probability reality itself is still waiting to be measured Multiverse hypothesis the universe is vast so vast in fact that our minds struggle to grasp its scale trillions of galaxies each with billions of stars spread across an unfathomable Cosmic expanse and yet even this staggering immensity might just be a fraction of the whole story what if our universe isn't the universe what if it's just one tiny bubble in an infinite ocean of universes each with its own laws of physics its own Dimensions its own strange reality this is the Multiverse hypothesis the idea that our universe isn't alone but merely one chapter in an endless Cosmic Anthology but where did this idea come from how did scientists rational thinkers grounded in observation and Mathematics arrive at such an extraordinary concept it began with an unexpected twist in cosmology inflation theory in the early 1980s physicist Alan GTH proposed a radical idea to solve some of the most puzzling questions about the universe's early moments according to girth in the first first fraction of a second after the big bang the universe underwent an unimaginably rapid expansion a brief period of inflation where space itself grew faster than the speed of light inflation explained why the universe looks so uniform on large scales why distant regions of space have nearly identical temperatures despite never having been in contact it was elegant it was powerful but inflation also carried A peculiar implication it might never have stopped in guth's model inflation isn't a one-time event it's a Perpetual process pockets of space stop inflating and form stable universes like bubbles popping in boiling water but the larger Cosmic soup keeps expanding endlessly generating more and more bubbles each one a separate Universe with its own properties its own physics in this view our universe is just one bubble in an infinite Cosmic foam but inflation isn't the only doorway into the Multiverse quantum mechanics the branch of physics governing the tiniest particles in existence offers another glimpse into this bewildering possibility in the 1950s physicist Hugh Everett proposed the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics at its core lies a deeply unsettling idea every time a Quantum event occurs the universe splits into multiple branches each representing a different outcome imagine flipping a coin in one Universe it lands heads in another tals every interaction every choice every Quantum possibility creates a branching path leading to countless parallel universes each as real as our own in one Universe you decided to stay home today in another you went outside and met a Str Ranger who changed your life forever it's dizzying it's almost incomprehensible and yet it emerges naturally from the mathematics of quantum theory then there's String Theory a framework attempting to unify all the forces of nature into one elegant equation according to string theory the universe operates not in three spatial Dimensions but in 10 or 11 depending on the variant of the theory these extra dimensions are hidden curled up at microscopic scales far beyond our ability to observe but they're not trivial they determine the very fabric of our universe from the strength of gravity to the behavior of subatomic particles and here's the twist String Theory doesn't predict one Universe it predicts a landscape a vast Cosmic map containing perhaps 10 500 different possible universes each with slightly different physical laws gravity might be weaker in one universe stronger in another Stars might not form in some While others could team with exotic forms of matter and energy if the Multiverse exists it could explain one of the deepest mysteries in physics the fine-tuning problem why are the fundamental constants of our universe the speed of light the charge of an electron the strength of gravity so perfectly tuned to allow life to exist if any of these values were slightly different Stars wouldn't form planets wouldn't orbit and complex chemistry wouldn't arise the Multiverse offers an answer it's not that our universe was designed to be perfect it's that countless universes exist each with different constants and we happen to exist in the rare one where the numbers align just right but here's the problem how do you prove it science thrives on observation on experiments on falsifiable itions but the Multiverse by its very nature exists beyond our Cosmic Horizon we cannot peer into other universes we cannot touch them measure them or observe them directly for some scientists this makes the Multiverse hypothesis unscientific an intriguing story but not a testable Theory but there are glimmers of Hope some researchers suggest that if other universes have ever colled Ed with ours like soap bubbles merging in a bath they might leave scars on the cosmic microwave background the faint Afterglow of the Big Bang others propose that subtle signatures in high energy physics experiments or anomalies in Cosmic radiation might Point towards the Multiverse but so far the evidence remains inconclusive the Multiverse is an idea on the edge of science a bridge between mathematics philosophy and Pure Imagination it challenges our most fundamental assumptions about existence are we just one Universe among countless others are there alternate versions of ourselves living alternate lives in alternate worlds or is the Multiverse simply An Elegant illusion a mathematical artifact without physical reality for now we don't know but the question lingers the universe our universe feels vast ancient and impossibly complex and yet it might be just one note in a far grander Cosmic Symphony playing across infinite dimensions and infinite possibilities the truth of the Multiverse remains hidden just Beyond the Horizon of our understanding but whether it's science philosophy or something in between one thing is certain the Multiverse hypothesis challenges us to rethink everything we thought we knew about reality existence and our place in the cosmos emergence of Consciousness and physics in the vast fabric of the universe woven from particles forces and fundamental laws there exists one phenomenon so bewildering so elusive that it seems to transcend the very framework of physics itself Consciousness you are experiencing it right now the hum of your thoughts the flicker of awareness as you process these words the undeniable sense of self that feels more real than the atoms making up your body but here's the puzzle how does Consciousness emerge from lifeless matter from Mere collections of quarks electrons and chemical reactions to tackle this question we must embark on a journey one that stretches from the microscopic dance of particles to the Colossal Machinery of the brain and finally to the Deep philosophical questions about the nature of reality physics has given us tools to understand the cosmos from the fusion of stars to the entanglement of particles across light years but can it explain the most intimate phenomenon of all the feeling of being you at its core Consciousness feels irreducible you can break down a star into hydrogen and helium or a cell into proteins and DNA but how do you break down a thought a sensation the feeling of red the taste of sweet weakness the agony of pain this is the hard problem of Consciousness a term coined by philosopher David Charmers it's not about explaining brain activity or neural Pathways that's the easy problem of Consciousness as strange as it may sound the hard problem asks why do these physical processes produce subjective experience why isn't the universe just a vast unfeeling machine science has made progress on the easy problem Neuroscience Maps brain regions tracks electrical signals and decodes the firing of neurons but despite these advances we don't know how neural activity transforms into experience it's as if we can describe every wire and circuit in a computer but we can't explain why the screen displays an image instead of just being a complex web of electronics some physicists believe that to crack the mystery of Consciousness we might need to reimagine our understanding of reality itself theories like integrated information Theory propose that Consciousness arises when information is meaningfully integrated in a complex system like the brain others like orchestrated objective reduction suggest that Quantum processes inside neurons might play a role that Consciousness could emerge from the quantum realm where particles behave in ways that defy classical intuition but this raises more questions is cons ious an emergent property like the wetness of water arising from hydrogen and oxygen atoms or is it something fundamental to the universe like space time and gravity some thinkers suggest that Consciousness might be woven into the very fabric of reality A Primitive property that exists at the deepest level of physics in this view every particle might have a sliver of awareness a tiny fragment of experience this idea known as pans psychism might sound radical but it's gaining traction among some serious philosophers and scientists let's pause for a moment and consider a thought experiment imagine an artificial brain a perfect replica of your own neuron for neuron signal for Signal would it have Consciousness would it feel Joy fear or curiosity or would it simply be an incredibly convincing machine a philosophical zombie simulating awareness without actually experiencing it if the answer is no that it would lack subjective experience then we might be missing something fundamental about how Consciousness arises there's also the idea that Consciousness and physics are deeply intertwined at the quantum level some scientists speculate that quantum entanglement where particles remain mysteriously connected across vast distances might mirror the way different regions of the brain synchronize to produce Unified experiences could Consciousness itself be a form of entanglement on a biological scale it's a tantalizing idea but one that remains firmly in the realm of speculation at the other end of the spectrum lies an unsettling possibility what if Consciousness is simply an illusion a trick played by our brains a convenient evolutionary adaptation to help us survive could it be that our sense of self our thoughts and our emotions are nothing more than the flickering of neurons a shadow play with no deeper meaning some scientists Embrace this view arguing that Consciousness is not something to be explained but something to be seen through like a mirage on a hot desert road but then you are still here listening experiencing feeling whatever the ultimate nature of Consciousness may be it is is undeniably real to you and that's the Paradox it's both the most immediate and the most mysterious aspect of our existence if we are ever to understand Consciousness physics and Neuroscience may need to join forces with philosophy computer science and perhaps disciplines we haven't even invented yet maybe the answer lies in a yet undiscovered law of nature a principle as profound as relativity or quantum mechanics or perhaps we're not equipped to answer this question at all that the key to Consciousness is locked in a room we can never enter but one thing is clear understanding Consciousness isn't just about solving a scientific puzzle it's about understanding ourselves our place in the universe and the Very nature of reality whether it's an emergent phenomenon a Quantum property or a fundamental aspect of existence Consciousness Remains the universe's greatest Enigma a mirror ref reflecting back not just the cosmos but the deepest questions about what it means to be so we leave this question hanging in the air as it has hung for centuries what is consciousness is it a trick of physics a spark of something Divine or the most fundamental layer of reality itself perhaps the answer lies within us waiting patiently somewhere between a firing neuron and a fleeting thought Theory of Everything at the heart of every scientific question hidden beneath layers of equations and galaxies there exists a single tantalizing dream a dream of absolute Unity a dream that somewhere in the Deep mathematical fabric of reality lies one equation one elegant idea that can describe everything every Star every atom every Force every fleeting moment of existence all encapsulated in a single cohesive framework this is the Quest for the theory of everything it's an idea so bold so ambitious that it feels almost mythological and yet for physicists it represents the Ultimate Prize a final answer to the grandest question of all why does the universe behave the way it does to understand this Quest we need to travel back to a time when physics was divided into kingdoms separate Realms ruled by separate laws on one side was the world of the very large galaxies black holes and the curving fabric of SpaceTime a world governed by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity where gravity is not a force pulling objects together but the very bending and warping of space and time itself on the other side was the world of the very small particles fields and Quantum probabilities a chaotic jittery realm described by quantum mechanics where electrons exist in clouds of possibil where particles can tunnel through barriers and where certainty is replaced by probability both theories are breathtakingly successful general relativity explains the movements of planets and the warping of Light by distant stars with exquisite Precision quantum mechanics underpins our understanding of chemistry Material Science and the Very functioning of the devices you're using to hear these words and yet they cannot coexist when we try to combine general relativity and quantum mechanics the mathematics fall apart equations spit out Infinities paradoxes arise and the Beautiful logic of both theories breaks down it's as if we're trying to stitch two incompatible Maps together one describing vast continents the other detailing the microscopic streets of a single City both maps are correct in their own domain but together they Clash the Quest for a Theory of Everything Is the quest to bridge this divide to find a single framework that can seamlessly describe the universe at all scales from the swirling gravity Wells of black holes to the Restless Quantum froth of subatomic particles one of the most promising candidates for this ultimate Theory emerged in the late 20th century and it came with a rather poetic name String Theory at its core string theory proposes that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are not particles but tiny vibrating strings infinitesimal Loops of energy each vibrating at a different frequency just as the strings of a violin produce different musical notes depending on how they vibrate these cosmic strings produce different particles depending on their vibration patterns electrons quarks photons they are not distinct objects but different notes played on the same Universal instrument it's a beautiful idea elegant harmonious and yet it comes with a cost String Theory doesn't work in our familiar Universe of three dimensions of space and one of time it demands extra Dimensions hidden layers of reality curled up so tightly that we can't see them 10 Dimensions maybe 11 realities stacked upon realities like hidden Pages folded within the universe for decades physicists have pursued String Theory crafting intricate mathematical models searching for experimental hints but so far the evidence remains elusive the strings if they exist are far too small to detect with our current technology the extra Dimensions remain stubbornly hidden tucked away in the folds of SpaceTime and so while String Theory remains a front runner it is not the only Contender another theory called Loop quantum gravity takes a different approach instead of strings it proposes that SpaceTime itself is not smooth and continuous but made of tiny indivisible Loops like pixels on a screen these Loops form the fabric of reality discrete building blocks of space and time both theories offer tantalizing glimpses into the same fundamental question what is reality made of but perhaps the problem isn't with our theories but with our assumptions what if the universe isn't a tidy set of mathematical laws waiting to be discovered what if our need for a single elegant theory is nothing more than a reflection of our human desire for Simplicity and Beauty the search for a theory of everything isn't just about physics it's about philosophy it's about whether the universe needs to make sense to us or whether it simply is are we chasing a mirage or are we genuinely on the verge of the most profound Discovery in the history of science for physicists like Steven Hawking this question was deeply personal Hawking spent much of his life searching for a unifying Theory driven by the belief that Humanity could one day know the mind of God and yet as he Grew Older Hawking began to doubt whether such a theory was even possible perhaps the universe is not governed by a single unifying principle but by a patchwork of overlapping laws a mosaic rather than a monolith and so the search continues in particle colliders buried deep underground in equations scrolled across white boards late into the night in the faint Whispers of gravitational waves Rippling through SpaceTime every Discovery brings us closer but also reveals how far we still have to go but maybe the beauty of The Theory of Everything isn't in the answer it's in the pursuit it's in the audacity of asking the biggest question imaginable it's in the realization that we fragile creatures on a tiny blue planet orbiting an ordinary star dare to believe that we can understand the universe itself whether or not we ever find The Theory of Everything the quest itself has transformed us it has shown us the Staggering complexity of reality the harmony hidden in chaos and the profound beauty of the cosmos and perhaps one day someone will write down a single equation a few lines of symbols on a chalkboard that will capture it all the stars the galaxies the particles the fields every fleeting moment every infinite expanse a cosmic Rosetta Stone unlocking the deepest secrets of existence but until that day comes the question remains is there a final answer to everything or will the universe always keep a part of itself hidden from view an eternal Enigma waiting in the Silence of space in the end The Theory of Everything Is Not just about understanding the universe it's about understanding ourselves why we ask why we wonder why we look at the night sky and feel the pull of something vast something unknowable and yet something deep deeply familiar nature constants nature often feels like it operates with unshakable Precision Stars ignite planets orbit and atoms vibrate in predictable patterns all governed by a set of fundamental constants these are the universal numbers etched into the very fabric of reality the speed of light the gravitational constant the charge of an electron they are the scaffolding upon which the universe builds its intricate architecture but what if these constants aren't constant at all this question might seem almost heretical after all the universe relies on these values being fixed if the gravitational constant changed even slightly Stars might not ignite galaxies might not form and Life as we know it would be impossible the universe would unravel into chaos yet some physicists suspect that these constants may not be as immovable as we assume and at the heart of this suspicion lies one of the strangest hypothetical particles ever conceived the Axion the Axion was first proposed to solve a problem within Quantum chromodynamics the theory describing how quarks interact via the strong nuclear force according to the mathematics this Force should violate something called CP symmetry a principle stating that if you swapped particles for antiparticles and flipped the universe in a mirror the laws of physics should remain unchanged but in the real world the strong force doesn't seem to violate the Symmetry at all it's too perfect too balanced this mismatch is called the strong CP problem and the Axion was born as a theoretical patch to fix it but as often happens in physics the Axion turned out to be more than just a mathematical Band-Aid if Axion exist they wouldn't just fix the strong force they might also play a key role in one of the greatest Cosmic puzzles of all time dark matter axians with their ghostly properties and Incredibly weak interactions with ordinary matter are prime candidates for the invisible Mass holding galaxies together yet the axion's potential doesn't stop there these elusive particles might also influence the fundamental constants of nature themselves in certain theoretical models axians could act like Cosmic dials subtly tuning con such as the fine structure constant which dictates how light interacts with charged particles if Axion can vary across space and time then constants might not be so constant after all astronomers have already begun searching for evidence of these Cosmic dials they look at distant light from quazars ancient beams stretched across billions of years and countless light years of space if the fine structure constant was slightly different billions of years ago the signature would be etched into this Ancient Light and in some studies hints have emerged tiny deviations anomalies that refuse to Disappear Completely but these findings are not yet definitive the search for axians continues in Laboratories buried deep underground shielded from cosmic noise scientists use magnetic fields and exquisitely sensitive detectors to try and catch the faintest whisper of these ghost particles each experiment brings us closer to an answer but so far the Axion remains elusive a faint silhouette on the horizon of our understanding if axians are found they would not only address long-standing problems in particle physics and cosmology but also challenge our Assumption of an unchanging Universe they could reveal that the constants of nature which seem so fundamental and eternal are Dynamic properties shaped by the universe itself for now the search continues across distant staright within magnetic traps and through mathematical models the Axion remains one of the most tantalizing possibilities in modern physics and with every experiment every flicker of anomalous data we inch closer to either discovering this elusive particle or rewriting the very rules we thought the universe was built upon the Pioneer anomaly far beyond the planets of our solar system in the cold and Silent void where sunlight Fades into Eternal darkness two lonely spacecraft drift through the cosmos the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 probes built by human hands launched on fiery rockets in the early 1970s were among the first emissaries of Earth to venture into Interstellar space space their mission to explore the outer planets and carry our curiosity beyond the edges of the known solar system but in the quiet decades that followed their launch scientists noticed something strange a faint whisper in the data an imperceptible tug as if some invisible force was ever so slightly pulling the probes back toward the sun this was the Pioneer anomaly a cosmic Riddle That would baffle scientists for decades and challenge our understanding of gravity itself when Pioneer 10 was launched in 1972 followed by Pioneer 11 A year later the probes carried with them golden plaques etched with Humanity's message to the Stars they journeyed past Jupiter and Saturn sending back breathtaking images and groundbreaking data eventually their trajectories took them outward beyond the realm of planets into the void where the sun is just another distant star everything seemed normal the laws of physics meticulously calculated by scientists had predicted their paths with extraordinary Precision but as the years passed radio signals from the probes revealed a puzzling discrepancy the spacecraft weren't exactly where they were supposed to be both Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 were drifting ever so slightly off their expected course moving slower than they should have been as if an invisible hand was gently pulling them back it wasn't much just a tiny deceleration about 110 billionth of a m/s squared insignificant on human scales but in the unforgiving Precision of space exploration this anomaly stood out like a beacon it was consistent persistent and deeply mysterious at first scientists questioned the data could it be an error in the instruments a glitch in the calculations but as more data rolled in the anomaly refused to disappear it became a stubborn fact An Inconvenient riddle that demanded an answer could this discrepancy point to new physics was there an unknown Force operating in the void of space or perhaps most unsettling of all could our understanding of gravity itself be incomplete theories began to emerge some suggested that the anomaly was caused by dark matter the invisible substance that makes up most of the universe's Mass others speculated about modified gravity theories exotic tweaks to Einstein's equations that might explain the strange tug on the probes and then there were the wild ideas hidden Dimensions Cosmic drag forces or even interactions with the quantum fabric of SpaceTime itself but before rewriting the physics textbooks scientists needed to rule out the mundane explanations could the anomaly be caused by heat the Pioneer probes after all carried radioactive power sources and heat emitted from these systems could in theory create tiny thrusts that might explain the drift this wasn't an exciting answer it was more engineering than Cosmic Revelation but science thrives on rigor not romance years of painstaking analysis followed researchers dug into telemetry data modeled thermal emissions and calculated the effect of every Photon of heat leaving the spacecraft and slowly a picture began to emerge it turned out that heat radiating unevenly from the back of the probes was creating a minuscule but persistent recoil effect like the faintest puff of air nudging the spacecraft ever so slightly backward in 2012 after Decades of debate the anomaly was largely explained the Myster ious deceleration wasn't caused by Dark Matter exotic physics or hidden Dimensions it was heat plain ordinary heat the universe it seemed hadn't broken its own rules after all but was this the end of the story not entirely the resolution of the Pioneer anomaly wasn't just about solving a cosmic puzzle it was a testament to the power of science itself it showed how patient investigation grounded in data and careful analysis can illuminate even the most stubborn Mysteries it reminded us that the universe doesn't yield its Secrets easily and sometimes the answer isn't in Grand sweeping theories but in the tinest details yet even with the anomaly explained the legacy of pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 endures these silent Travelers continue their lonely drift through the Stars their signals have long faded the systems have gone quiet but they remain out there Messengers from a small blue planet orbiting an ordinary star carrying our curiosity and our questions into the infinite night and somewhere perhaps in the distant future another civilization might stumble upon one of these probes they might see the golden plaque with its etched diagram of a man and woman and wonder about the strange creatures who sent it they might even ask themselves what drove these beings to launch such fragile machines into the vast cold dark the Pioneer anomaly began as a question about physics but it ends as a reflection on something deeper it's about our insatiable need to explore to question and to understand it's a reminder that every mystery we solve brings us closer to the heart of reality and every answer leads to more questions the Journey of the pioneer probes isn't just a story of space exploration it's a story of Humanity's enduring curiosity and as they sail through the endless dark they remind us of something profound the universe is vast mysterious and waiting always waiting for us to ask the next question neutrino oscillations and anomalies in the grand Orchestra of the cosmos neutrons are the quiet performers small unassuming particles tucked inside the heart parts of atoms playing a crucial role in the structure of matter without them Stars wouldn't shine atoms wouldn't hold together and the universe as we know it wouldn't exist but there's something deeply puzzling about these humble particles when freed from the safety of an atomic nucleus neutrons face an existential crisis they Decay quietly inevitably transforming into protons electrons and neutrinos in a process called beta Decay but here's the strange part no one can agree on how long they take to do it it's called the neutron lifetime discrepancy and it's one of the most stubborn and perplexing mysteries in modern physics two different methods for measuring the lifetime of a free Neutron methods that should agree perfectly consistently produce answers that differ by about 9 seconds 9 seconds may not sound like much but in the Precision driven world of particle physics it's a Chasm a Chasm wide enough to hint at something deeper something hidden in the laws of nature could it be a flaw in our experiments a subtle effect we've overlooked or could it be evidence of something truly extraordinary like the existence of unknown physics just beyond our reach to understand the puzzle we need to shrink down to dive into the invisible world of subatomic particles where force is stronger than anything in our daily experience hold protons and neutrons together inside Atomic nuclei neutrons are like Cosmic glue inside a nucleus they're stable bound tightly alongside protons by the strong nuclear force but when you set a nutron free when it's no longer cradled by the protective shell of its Atomic family it becomes unstable like a clock ticking toward inevitability on average a free Neutron lives for about 15 minutes before decaying into a proton an electron and an anti-neutrino but how do we measure something so fleeting so small and so utterly invisible to the naked eye physicists have devised two primary methods the bottle method and the beam method in the bottle method scientists trap neutrons in a carefully designed magnetic or gravitational bottle a kind of invisible cage that keeps the particles confined over time they count how many neutrons remain and calculate the average time it takes for them to Decay the bottle method gives a neutron lifetime of about 8799 seconds in the beam method physicists take a very different approach they fire a beam of free neutrons through a detector and measure how many protons are produced from Neutron Decay over time using this data they calculate the Neutron's lifetime indirectly the beam method however consist instantly returns a slightly longer lifetime around 888 seconds these two methods should align the universe doesn't have one set of rules for neutrons trapped in a bottle and another for neutrons in a beam but no matter how many times the experiments are repeated the discrepancy persists for years scientists have checked and rechecked their calculations they've upgraded their equipment refined their Tech techniques and eliminated every obvious source of error and yet the 9sec Gap remains hanging in the air like an unsolved riddle at first glance it might seem like a technical problem an experimental inconsistency waiting to be ironed out but some physicists are beginning to suspect something far more profound that this discrepancy could be a sign of new physics lurking in the shadows one IDE idea is that neutrons might not always Decay into the familiar Trio of proton electron and anti-neutrino instead they might occasionally Decay into something else something invisible something we've never detected perhaps a neutron sometimes vanishes into a hidden particle like a dark matter candidate If This Were true it would mean that every Neutron lifetime experiment is unintentionally glimpsing a doorway into the unknown a fleeting interaction with a hidden sector of the universe other physicists suggest that the discrepancy might point to a deeper flaw in our understanding of the weak nuclear force the force responsible for Neutron Decay could it be that our equations our assumptions are missing a term a correction and insight the implications are staggering if neutrons can Decay into Dark Matter it would not only solve the neutron lifetime puzzle but also shine a spotlight on one of the greatest mysteries in modern cosmology the true nature of Dark Matter itself but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence right now the neutron lifetime discrepancy remains a stubborn anomaly an itch on the surface of physics refusing to go away new experiments are being designed with even tighter controls and even greater Precision physicists are building more sensitive Neutron traps more refined beams and detectors capable of capturing The faintest Whispers of particle interactions and while these experiments run the universe Waits because the neutron lifetime isn't just a quirky detail for particle physicists to argue about it's a Cornerstone of our understanding of the cosmos the exact lifetime of a free Neutron influences the abundance of elements created in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis the cosmic recipe that cooked up hydrogen helium and lithium in the first few minutes after the Big Bang get the neutron lifetime wrong and our entire model of the early Universe starts to wobble so here we are standing at the edge of an unanswered question two measurements two answers one mystery somewhere buried in those 9 seconds is a clue a flicker of something extraordinary waiting to be understood perhaps the answer lies hidden in the particles we cannot see in forces we cannot yet measure or in the Uncharted corners of physical law or perhaps like so many great mysteries in science the truth is waiting just beyond the reach of our instruments waiting for the next leap in technology or for a mind bold enough to see the pattern hidden in the noise for now neutrons continue their silent dance in bottles and beams in the hearts of stars and the depths of Laboratories they Decay and vanish ticking out their fleeting LIF expand against the vast backdrop of time somewhere in those ticks those tiny invisible seconds is an answer and if we can find it it just might change everything we thought we knew about the universe neutrino oscillations and anomalies in the quiet corners of the universe where Starlight Fades into the endless dark and particles drift silently across the void there exists a mystery so profound that it challenges our very understanding of reality it begins with the neutrino a particle so elusive so ghostlike that trillions of them are passing through your body right now without leaving a trace neutrinos are cosmic Phantoms Whispering secrets from the hearts of stars from exploding Supernova and from the most violent corners of the cosmos and yet despite their abundance despite their omnipresence they remain one of the greatest enigmas in physics Our Story begins in the 1930s with a problem a problem that haunted physicists like Wolf Gang poy during experiments with radioactive decay scientists noticed something odd the energy from decaying particles wasn't adding up it was as if a portion of the energy was simply disappearing poly desperate to preserve the sacred laws of physics proposed a radical idea what if there was an invisible particle so small and so reluctant to interact with matter that it simply Slipped Away undetected during radioactive decay he called it the neutrino meaning little neutral one in Italian it was a bold prediction and at the time it sounded almost impossible to verify neutrinos are uncharged Ed nearly massless and interact so weakly with matter that they can pass through a light year of lead without slowing down but in 1956 physicists Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reigns finally detected them in a nuclear reactor experiment the ghostly particles were real but this was just the beginning over the following decades neutrinos would reveal themselves to be far Stranger than anyone had anticipated physicists discovered that there were not one but three types of neutrinos each associated with a different particle the electron neutrino the muon neutrino and the to neutrino and here's where the mystery deepens neutrinos it turns out can change from one type to another as they travel through space this phenomenon is known as neutrino oscillation imagine firing a beam of neutrinos Across the Universe you might start with a pure stream of electron neutrinos but by the time they reach a detector on the other side some of them have transformed into mu neutrinos and others into to neutrinos it's as if these particles can't decide what they want to be they exist in a state of Perpetual identity crisis shapeshifting as they move through the cosmos but here's the catch according to the standard model of particle physics neutr inos should be massless the theory insists that they should ZIP through space at the speed of light unburdened by mass yet neutrino oscillations require them to have mass without mass they couldn't change flavors they would be frozen in their initial State this means that neutrinos are living proof that the standard model is incomplete they are cracks in the foundation of one of our most cherished theories but the story doesn't end there neutrino experiments have uncovered anomalies strange unexplained results that hint at something even deeper something we don't yet understand take for example the solar neutrino problem the sun powered by nuclear fusion in its core should produce an enormous number of electron neutrinos physicists built massive underground detectors like super cameo cande in Japan and Sno Sudbury neutrino observatory in Canada to catch these fleeting visitors from our Star but when the data came in there was a problem only about 1/3 of the expected electron neutrinos were being detected it was as if 2/3 of them had simply vanished on their Journey from the Sun to Earth the answer turned out to be neutrino oscillation as the electron neutrinos traveled through space many of them were transforming into Moon and to neut OS types that the detectors at the time weren't sensitive to the mystery was solved but the implications were staggering neutrinos not only have mass but they also behave in ways that defy our standard understanding of partical physics and then there are the reactor neutrino anomalies in experiments designed to study neutrinos produced by nuclear reactors scientists found something puzzling a persistent shortage of detected neutrinos compared to theoretical predictions this discrepancy has led some physicists to propose the existence of a fourth type of neutrino a sterile neutrino unlike the three known types sterile neutrinos wouldn't interact with matter at all except through gravity they would be even more ghostly more intangible than their already elusive cousins if sterile neutrinos exist they could answer some of the biggest question questions in physics they might be linked to Dark Matter the invisible scaffolding holding galaxies together they might hold Clues to the universe's matter antimatter asymmetry explaining why our Cosmos is filled with matter rather than being annihilated into Pure Energy but finding sterile neutrinos is like trying to hear a whisper in a hurricane experiments like diabe Minos and Ice Cube have searched for their faint signatures and while hints have appeared definitive proof remains elusive every discovery about neutrinos seems to peel back one layer of the mystery only to reveal another beneath it neutrinos are messengers from the hidden Realms of the universe they're born in the fiery hearts of stars in the cataclysmic explosions of supernova and in the depths of nuclear reactors they pass through planets stars and even black holes carrying with them secrets about the most extreme conditions in nature they are both incredibly ordinary they flood the universe in staggering numbers and profoundly strange refusing to fit neatly into our theoretical Frameworks but perhaps the most remarkable thing about neutrinos isn't just their ghostly nature or their shape-shifting identities it's the questions they force us to ask why do they have mass are there more types waiting to be discovered could they be connected to the the dark matter that fills the cosmos in every detector buried deep underground in every beam fired across continents physicists are listening for answers they're watching for faint flashes of light tiny ripples in their instruments that could reveal another piece of the puzzle the universe it seems speaks to us in Whispers And neutrinos these silent ghostly Messengers are some of the quietest voices of all but if we can learn to listen if we can decipher their faint signals they might just tell us a story unlike any we've ever heard a story about the Deep structure of reality the hidden symmetries of the cosmos and perhaps just perhaps the ultimate fate of the universe itself proton decay in the quiet depths of time beneath the surface of reality where protons and neutrons Stitch the universe together a silent clock may be ticking it's a clock so slow so faint that it's almost imperceptible a countdown woven into the fabric of every atom in your body every molecule of water every star in the sky it's the question of proton decay one of the greatest Unsolved Mysteries in modern physics protons are the Bedrock of matter they form the hearts of atoms anchoring electrons in their orbits and giving structure to everything we see in touch for all practical purposes protons are Eternal they don't age they don't wither and they don't fall apart at least not within the limits of our current understanding but what if that isn't true what if given enough time even the proton this Cornerstone of reality will crumble into something else if protons Decay it means something something profound the universe is not built on permanence even the most fundamental pieces of matter have an expiration date a moment when their structure will fail and they'll dissolve into smaller more ethereal particles it means that everything every Galaxy every Star every atom will one day Fade Away into nothingness but here's the twist despite Decades of searching no one has ever seen a proton decay to understand understand why this question matters so deeply we need to go back to the fundamental building blocks of reality the standard model of particle physics this model is our best attempt at describing the universe at its smallest scales it tells us about quarks and leptons about photons and gluons about the invisible threads of force that hold matter together and according to this model protons should be stable forever but physics doesn't stop at the standard model there are theories that go further theories that try to unite the fundamental forces of nature gravity electromagnetism the weak force and the strong force into one elegant framework these are called Grand unified theories or guts and in these theories protons are not Eternal they can in fact Decay imagine a proton sitting quietly at the center of an atom in its decaying moment an event so rare it might only happen once every 10 to the power 34 years it would suddenly transform spitting out a Cascade of exotic particles the exact details depend on the theory you choose but one common prediction is that a proton would Decay into a positron a positively charged electron and a neutral P which itself would quickly Decay into gamma rays bursts of light a single proton's death would be a faint flicker an almost imperceptible sigh in the darkness but multiplied across every proton in every atom in the universe it would Mark the slow unraveling of matter itself but here's the problem we've never seen it happen physicists have built enormous underground Laboratories to search for proton decay shielding their detectors from cosmic rays and background noise take the Super cameand experiment in Japan a giant tank filled with 50, th000 tons of Ultra Pure Water buried deep beneath a mountain it's surrounded by thousands of sensitive light detectors watching waiting hoping to see the faint Telltale glow of a proton's final breath years have passed decades even and yet nothing does this mean protons are truly Eternal or are we just not looking in the right way maybe our theories are incomplete maybe protons do Decay but in ways we haven't anticipated or on time scales so vast they stretch far beyond our ability to observe them the search for proton decay isn't just about particles it's about the fate of the universe if protons are stable then matter could in principle exist forever Stars might fade galaxies might scatter but the protons would endure a silent Eternal sea of particles drifting in the cosmic dark but if protons Decay then the universe has an end game in the unimaginably distant future long after stars have burned out and black holes have evaporated the Final Act of the cosmos will be the slow quiet decay of protons atom by atom molecule by molecule the very substance of reality would disintegrate into radiation fading into a thin cold mist of photons and neutrinos the stakes are enormous and the timeline is inconceivably vast but here's the strange beauty of physics even when we're dealing with time scales longer than the age of the universe itself even when the signals we're searching for are faint glimmers on the edge of detectability we still look why why spend decades billions of dollars and countless hours chasing something so elusive so ethereal because answering this question isn't just about protons it's about our universe our reality and our place within it if protons Decay then the cosmos isn't static it's Dynamic changing evolving on scales far beyond our human lifetimes and if protons are Eternal then we have to ask why what makes them so perfectly stable in a universe that seems to favor chaos and change every experiment that runs in the Silence of underground Laboratories every Photon captured by a detector every Theory scribbled on a physicist's chalkboard it's all part of a larger story a story about the most basic rules of reality about whether the universe itself has a final chapter or whether it will drift endlessly into an unchanging eternity somewhere buried in the noise of our experiments hidden in the equations we have yet to solve the answer is is waiting maybe it's in a single flicker of light deep underground a faint whisper from a dying proton or maybe it's in a theory we haven't thought of yet a new framework that will reshape everything we know for now the protons in your body remain stable they sit quietly holding your atoms together building the structures of your reality but somewhere perhaps in a distant star perhaps deep underground perhaps in a single part particle floating through the void one proton might already be ticking away its final seconds the cosmic lithium problem in the aftermath of the Big Bang the universe was a swirling cauldron of unimaginable heat and density protons neutrons and electrons danced in chaos colliding and fusing in a cosmic crucible that set the stage for everything we see today as the universe cooled something miraculous happened a process known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis in this brief window just minutes after the birth of time itself the First Light Elements were forged hydrogen helium and a delicate trace of lithium these elements would become the foundation for stars galaxies and eventually life itself but amidst this elegant story of creation something doesn't quite add up enter the cosmic lithium problem a Riddle That is defied explanation for decades according to our most reliable models of the early Universe there should be three times more lithium in the cosmos than what we actually observe somehow somewhere this delicate metal either disappeared was destroyed or never formed in the quantities we expected it's a paradox that gws at the edges of cosmology hinting at either a gap in our understanding of nuclear physics or something far stranger lurking in the fabric reality to understand the issue we need to revisit those first few minutes of cosmic history hydrogen the simplest and most abundant element formed almost effortlessly helium followed its formation governed by well understood nuclear reactions but lithium the third element on the periodic table was a far more delicate player in this primordial dance it Formed under extremely specific conditions requiring a careful balance of temperature pressure and particle interactions even a slight deviation could disrupt its production our models predict that about one lithium atom should have formed for every 10 billion hydrogen atoms but when astronomers peer into the oldest Stars ancient Stellar relics that have remained largely unchanged since the dawn of time they consistently find only a third of the expected lithium it's as if 2/3 of the lithium that should should exist simply vanished for decades scientists have wrestled with this anomaly some proposed that the lithium was somehow destroyed inside Stars burned away in their fiery cuse but this explanation has its limits many of the Stars studied are ancient and relatively cool unlikely to have processed their lithium so thoroughly others suggested that lithium might have been diluted in the outer layers of stars hidden from our telescopes yet even the most advanced observations struggle to reconcile the discrepancy in 2012 researchers turned their attention to Exotic physics could it be that unknown particles perhaps remnants from the early Universe interfered with lithium production the idea of beyond the standard model physics began to surface an unseen factor that disrupted the delicate nucleosynthesis process some theorists even proposed that dark matter particles played a role subtly altering the nuclear reactions responsible for lithium's creation then there's the tantalizing possibility that our understanding of the early universe itself is incomplete what if Big Bang nuclear synthesis didn't proceed quite as we imagined what if an unknown phase transition a cosmic event hidden in the earliest moments of time changed the rules of the game game these are not casual speculations they represent cracks in our otherwise robust understanding of cosmology but the cosmic lithium problem doesn't just reside in the distant past lithium is crucial for Life as we know it it's a key element in modern technology essential for batteries that power our devices more intriguingly lithium plays a role in brain chemistry with lithium salts used as mood stabilizers in treating certain mental health conditions how strange it is to think that this humble element essential for both technology and biology carries with it a cosmic mystery and so we're left with an unresolved Enigma the universe despite all its elegance and mathematical Precision still hides secrets in plain sight the cosmic lithium problem isn't just about a missing element it's a reminder of our limits a gap in our Cosmic map that Whispers of something we don't yet understand maybe the solution lies in new physics waiting to be discovered in the cold collisions of particle accelerators or perhaps it's hidden in the light of distant Stars waiting for more advanced telescopes to reveal their secrets for now lithium remains an elusive puzzle piece in the grand Mosaic of the cosmos but isn't that what makes science beautiful the unanswered questions the Mysteries that pull us forward the cosmic lithium problem is more than just a discrepancy it's a doorway a clue that somewhere deep in the fabric of reality something profound awaits our Discovery and one day perhaps not too far from now we'll find it heat death of universe the universe feels alive Stars Burn brightly planets orbit in delicate balance and galaxies swirl across the cosmic tapestry in Grand sweeping arcs from the smallest atom to the largest black hole energy flows motion persists and Time Marches forward but one day it will all stop every Star will flicker out every Galaxy will grow cold and every trace of motion Every Spark of energy will fade into silence this is the heat death of the universe a haunting vision of the cosmos's Final Chapter a universe where nothing nothing happens nothing changes and nothing will ever again but how could such a fate come to pass how does a universe filled with fiery stars and vibrant galaxies wind down into an eternal Frozen Stillness to understand we need to talk about entropy in the mid 19th century physicists like Rudolph clausius and ludvig boltzman introduced the concept of entropy a measure of disorder in a system imagine a cup of hot coffeee sitting in a cold room over time the heat from the coffee spreads into the air eventually the coffee and the room will reach the same temperature and heat will stop flowing the system has reached thermal equilibrium the universe operates on the same Principle Energy always flows from areas of high concentration to low concentration from hot to cold from ordered to disordered and every time energy flows a little bit of it becomes unusable locked away in forms that can no no longer do work this is the second law of Thermodynamics one of the most fundamental rules of physics entropy always increases in a closed system and the universe is the ultimate closed system right now our universe is in a state of incredible activity Stars fuse hydrogen into helium releasing immense energy planets absorb staright black holes consume matter energy flows in Endless Cycles driving the dance of galaxies and the light of stars but it won't last forever stars are not Eternal in about 100 trillion years the last Stars will burn out these will be red dwarfs small cool stars that burn their fuel with agonizing slowness but even they will eventually exhaust their hydrogen when the final star flickers Into Darkness a new era Begins the degenerate era black holes neutron stars and white dwarfs will dominate the universe these objects are remnants of stars Stellar corpses they don't shine they don't create they simply exist but even they won't last forever over unimaginably long time scales white dwarfs will cool to become black dwarfs Frozen husks of carbon and oxygen drifting through space meanwhile black holes will slowly evaporate through a phenomenon called Hawking radiation in the 1970s phys phist Steven Hawking discovered that black holes aren't perfectly black they emit tiny amounts of radiation losing mass in the process over 10 what or 100 years a number so vast it defies comprehension every black hole in the universe will evaporate into nothing what's left after that only particles protons electrons neutrinos drifting through an endless lightless void and even these particles might not be Eternal some theories suggest that protons could eventually Decay leaving behind a universe filled with nothing but low energy photons and wisps of radiation no stars no planets no black holes just a thin cold mist of particles spread across an infinite void at this point the universe will have reached maximum entropy every every last bit of usable energy will have been distributed evenly there will be no gradients no flows of heat or energy no chance for complexity or structure to arise time in any meaningful sense will lose its purpose because time as we understand it is tied to change and in a universe where nothing changes does time even exist this is the heat death a universe where everything has settled into the final inevitable Stillness but there's a strange Beauty to this Grim fate for billions of years Stars burned brightly galaxies danced and life brief and fragile emerged to witness it all the universe was a stage and for a fleeting moment it was filled with light sound and movement but nothing lasts forever and perhaps in some distant corner of this fading Cosmos there will be one final spark a photon escaping from the last decaying particle racing through an Endless Night carrying with it the faintest echo of a universe that once was vibrant and full of life the heat death of the universe is not a dramatic end there will be no explosion no cataclysm no Grand Finale just a slow Relentless fading until everything is quiet the story of the universe began with a bang but it will end in a whisper a long cold silent sigh stretched across eternity"

        "transcription": "Hi! You‚Äôre on a rock. Floating in space. Surrounded by more rocks. And gas. And a bunch of nothing, mainly. Oh hey, look at that, the rocks are going\naround the gas. Hold on, what the heck, is going on here? To understand, let‚Äôs look a little bit of\nPhysics. Wait, did I say a little bit? To find out what kind of magic this is, we‚Äôll\nhave to go back in time. Okay, not that far. Stop! Yeah. That‚Äôs perfect. This is gravity guy. But most people call him ‚ÄúIsaac Newton‚Äù. One important thing he said is that Force\nequals mass times acceleration. Now what do all these words even mean? Force is just a push or pull on something,\nin a certain direction. Mass tells you how much of something there\nis, and it‚Äôs also a measure of inertia, but we‚Äôll get to that later, and acceleration\nis the derivative of velocity with respect to time, but that‚Äôs too many big words for\nmy taste, so let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs how fast velocity is changing. The key takeaway is that if you apply a Force\nto a fixed mass, you get a predictable amount of acceleration. If you know all the forces acting on a basketball\nmid-air, you can predict with 100% certainty if the ball will go in the hoop or your neighbours\nwindshield. ‚ÄúWhoa, did an apple just fall on my head?‚Äù Yes Newton, it did. ‚ÄúThat must have happened for a reason‚Äù\nsaid Newton, as he discovered that two masses attract one another, making the apple fall. Yes, even you, no matter how ugly you think\nyou are, attract pretty much the whole universe, at least a little bit. Hey, can you put that on paper? ‚Äúyup‚Äù said Newton, who gave us the Law\nof Universal Gravitation. In other words, how much two bodies pull on\neach other, given their mass and distance, times a constant. Bigger mass? Bigger Pull. Bigger distance? Smaller pull. Actually, a lot smaller pull. You see, the as the distance increases, the\nForce gets smaller by the square. That my friends, is the Inverse-Square Law. Gravity is also the reason why the planets\nin our solar system orbit the sun. They got their initial velocity when the solar\nsystem formed out of spinning gas, and since there‚Äôs nothing in space to stop them from\nmoving, they‚Äôll keep moving. Hey, that‚Äôs Newton‚Äôs first Law. The sun is so massive, that the force of gravity\nkeeps pulling the planets towards the sun, but the planets are fast enough to essentially\nfall towards the sun but miss it, and this goes on forever, creating a round orbit. Actually, that‚Äôs kind of a lie. Most orbits orbits are not perfectly round\nbut more egg-shaped and pluto‚Äôs orbit is just‚Ä¶a complete mess. But you get the idea. In this case, the gravity is what we call\na centripetal force. One thing many people confuse is mass and\nweight, and no, they are not the same. Mass tells you how much of this blob there\nis, and Weight is the force of Gravity the blob would feel. To make things clear, your mass would be the\nsame on the earth and on the moon, but the ‚Äúweight‚Äù you would perceive, is different,\nbecause the moon has a weaker gravitational pull, meaning, a weaker force acting on your\nmass. So really, you‚Äôre not overweight, you‚Äôre\njust on the wrong planet. Aight, enough about Newton, let‚Äôs break\nsome stuff. If you ever dropped your phone, it might look\nlike this: What the hell ground, why‚Äôd you do that? The answer is Energy. You know, the thing kids have after eating\ngummy bears. Energy has the unit Joule. And it‚Äôs not like Force, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt\nhave a direction, it‚Äôs just a number, that‚Äôs kind of chilling there, as a property of a\nthing. You see, there‚Äôs two main kinds of energy:\nKinetic energy, and potential energy. In plain English, energy of movement, and\nstored energy due to some circumstance. For example, when you held your phone, it\nstored gravitational potential energy, due to being held above the ground, at a certain\nheight. Once you dropped it, the potential energy\nwas converted into kinetic energy, as the phone fell. Then it smashed into the ground, and the phone\nabsorbed some of the energy making the screen go boom. Work is defined as Force applied over distance. For example:\nIf you lift an apple by 1 meter, you would have done about 1 Joule of work. This happened by converting chemical energy\nstored in your body to gravitational potential energy stored in the apple. As you may have noticed, Energy and Work have\nthe same unit ‚ÄúJoule‚Äù. So they must be the same thing? Uhhh, No. Energy is the total amount of work that a\nthing could possibly do. Work is just the stuff that actually happened\nand required energy. You know, force applied over a distance, which\nmost often implies converting energy from one form to another. If you try to lift a weight that‚Äôs too heavy\nfor you, you‚Äôd feel like that took a bunch of work, right? Well, yes, but your feelings are invalid in\nthe face of Physics! Mathematically, no work has been done! Because, work is a force applied over a distance. And since you didn‚Äôt move the weight at\nall, no distance means no work. The key thing to remember about energy is\nthat it cannot be created or destroyed, only converted. Aka, the conservation of energy. Okay, but a car, that‚Äôs moving has kinetic\nenergy. When the car stops, assuming the car doesn‚Äôt\nsmash into a wall, where does that energy go? When you apply the brakes, there‚Äôs friction\nbetween the brakes and the wheels, causing the car to slow down, and creating heat as\na byproduct. That heat is then dissipated to the surrounding\nair. And that makes the molecules in the air move\nfaster. And things that move have kinetic energy. So ultimately, the kinetic energy is transferred\nfrom the car to the air. With this knowledge, we can define that Temperature\nis just the average kinetic energy of atoms in a system. You see, all atoms, not just molecules in\nthe air, wiggle. Like this. The faster they move, the hotter things get. That is temperature. All that talk about hot stuff, I think it‚Äôs\ntime we talk about Thermodynamics. It tells us that jumping in lava is probably\na bad idea, but more importantly, the absolute mess that is entropy. Literally, it tells you how much disorder\nthere is in a system, indicating the number of possible states a system can be in. For example, get an ice cube, no not that\none, yes that‚Äôs perfect, and put it in the sun. The sun will obliterate the ice cube and turn\nit into water. Looking at the structure of ice and water,\nwe can see that ice is more neatly organized than water, which just kind of goes all over\nthe place. Also, the water could look like this, or this,\nor even this, but the ice will always look a little something like this. In total, the system went from low entropy\nto high entropy, meaning more disorder and more possible microstates. This trend applies everything. The whole universe is on an unstoppable path\nto higher entropy. It‚Äôs also the reason why time seems to go\nonly forwards, or at least, that‚Äôs what we believe at this point. Practically, entropy tells us that some forms\nof energy are more useful for doing work than others. Burn some gasoline, and your car will move,\nspitting out heat and gas. That heat and gas is pretty much gasoline,\njust in the form of higher entropy. And as you can imagine, this stuff won‚Äôt\nreally make your car move, and the gas won‚Äôt spontaneously turn back into liquid gasoline. Meaning, the form of gasoline with lower entropy\nis more useful for doing work. Okay, but if you put some water in the freezer,\nwill it not decrease in entropy? Yes, BUT the fridge is not an isolated system\nand will heat up the room more than it will cool down the water, increasing the total\nentropy. Wanna see some magic? Woah, what just happened? Some electrons apparently moved through some\nwires and let there be light. What is going on here? Objects have a fancy something called a charge. It can be positive or negative. Or, if you have the same amount of both, an\nobject is neutral. Electrons have a single negative charge. The flow of electrons is called electric current. To describe it, we use three parameters: Current,\nVoltage, and Resistance. Current is the amount of electrons passing\nthrough a wire in a given amount of time, Voltage is what pushes the electrons to move,\nbut simply put, it‚Äôs a difference in electric potential, so you can imagine it as a slope\nthat goes from high potential to low potential, where the flow of current goes downhill, and\nresistance is pretty self explanatory. This is Coulomb‚Äôs Law. Wait a minute, this is just Newton‚Äôs Law\nof Gravitation in disguise! This tells us that electric charges attract\neach other in a similar way masses do. Opposites want to cuddle, while like charges\nliterally couldn‚Äôt think of a more disgusting thing than to be with one another. These four equations explain pretty much all\nof electromagnetism. But don‚Äôt be scared just because they look\nscary! I mean, yeah, they do, but it‚Äôs simpler\nthan it seems at first. The first one states that if there is an electric\ncharge, there will be an Electric field, or this big E, emerging form it. Add another and you have an electrostatic\nfield. These lines tell us in which direction a charged\nparticle would feel a force at any given point. The second one tells us the same for magnetic\nfields, AND, even though electric charges are cool and can be alone, magnetic poles,\nare not. They‚Äôre very lonely. There will always be a north pole together\nwith a south pole, and a single pole can never be alone. Okay now here‚Äôs where things get kind of\nfreaky. You know how electric charges only act on\nother charges, and magnets only affect other magnets? Well that‚Äôs only true if they‚Äôre not moving. The third and fourth maxwell equations tell\nus that a moving magnet creates an electric field, and a moving charge or electric field\ncreates a magnetic field. One consequence of this is that current can\nseemingly come ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù by moving a magnet next to a conductor. The moving magnet creates and electric field,\nwhich makes the electrons inside the conductors go crazy. That is called induction. It‚Äôs the reason why your phone charges when\nyou put in on the charging pad, even though it is not directly connected to a cable. In other words, electric and magnetic fields\nare so tightly linked that they are the two parts of the same bigger thing. Let‚Äôs say we have a charge. Since it doesn‚Äôt move, it has a static electric\nfield. If we accelerate the charge, there will be\na magnetic field around it. That magnetic field interacts with the electric\nfield, which again changes the magnetic field, and this is a sort of chain reaction that\nmakes the electromagnetic field radiate outwards into space as an electromagnetic wave. Depending on the frequency, the human eye\ncan actually see this, it‚Äôs called light, but most of the spectrum is invisible to the\nhuman eye and is used for things such as Bluetooth, wireless charging and confusing human apes\ninto thinking magic is real. Hey, can we go back to the water and look\nat those molecules? Yeah, those, what are they made of? The molecules are made of Atoms. Atoms are made of a core and some electrons. The core is made of protons and neutrons,\nboth of which are made of quarks. They‚Äôre strange yet charming, from up top\ndown to the bottom. Oh yeah there‚Äôs some more stuff, like for\nexample the overweight brothers of the electron. All of this together makes up the standard\nmodel, which we believe to be the smallest things in the universe. At least that‚Äôs the excuse we have for not\nknowing what quarks are made of. Fun Fact! Depending on the number of protons in the\ncore, you get different elements. Depending on the number of Neutrons in the\ncore, you get different Isotopes of the same element. Most of which are a little overweight and\nvery unstable. So they fall apart, into smaller atoms. That releases ionizing radiation. Not so fun fact: That stuff will kill you. Do not play with radioactive atoms. If you have a large group of atoms, you can\npredict when half of those will have fallen apart. That‚Äôs the halflife. Depending on how unstable an isotope is, it\nwill survive a certain amount of time. Some don‚Äôt want to live, some really don‚Äôt\nwant to live, but some will live far longer than you probably will. Oh yeah, did I mention that light is like\nthe fastest thing in the universe? To be exact, 299, 792, 458 meters per second\nin a vacuum. ‚ÄúThat is pretty fast‚Äù said everyone. Also, ‚ÄúLight is a wave‚Äù said everyone. Why? If you shoot it through two teeny tiny slits\nit creates a fancy pattern due to interference, which is just a wave thing. You see, when two waves cross, they can add\nup, or cancel each other out. These gaps, are the spots where they cancel\neach other out, so in this case, light behaves like a wave. ‚ÄúNah, screw that, everything you know is\nwrong‚Äù said Albert Einstein, probably smoking crack, after hearing about the photoelectric\neffect and discovering that light comes in tiny packets called photons. I sure hope that doesn‚Äôt unravel a whole\nnew area of phyiscs, haha. ‚ÄúAnyway‚Äù he said, as he continued to casually\ndrop an absolute bomb on the entire field of physics with his theory of relativity:\nHe assumed the speed of light is constant because it arises from two other constants. He also assumed the laws of physics are the\nsame for everyone, regardless if moving or at rest. Now think about it: If two people turn on\na flashlight, but one person is standing still, while the other person is on a moving train,\nwouldn‚Äôt the person standing still see the other person‚Äôs light as going faster than\nthe speed of light? The reality is: NO! It would be the same as their own flashlight. That‚Äôs impossible, except if time passes\nslower for that person from the perspective of this person. In other words, if the speed of light is constant,\ntime must be relative. Also, gravity is not actually a Force, sorry\nNewton, but rather a consequence of masses bending spacetime. Einstein thought that the universe is a mesh\nof space and time, and anything with a mass bends this fabric. Also, all objects move freely on a straight\nline when moving through space. Gravitation is simply the result of objects\nfollowing these bent lines, which appear straight to them. If you have a hard time understanding this,\nyou can imagine two people on earth, walking in parallel, straight lines. On a short distance, the straight lines will\nnever meet. Now imagine one standing on the east cost,\nand one the west coast of the US. If they both walk north, eventually, they\nwill meet at the north pole. Because of the curvature of the earth, they\nended up at the same point even though they both walked ‚Äústraight‚Äù relative to themselves. ‚ÄúOh yeah by the way Energy and mass are\nkind of the same thing‚Äù he added, which explains why atom bombs are so frickin powerful. According to this formula, even just tiny\natoms can release a humongous amount of energy by giving up just a fraction of their mass\nduring fission. What is Fission? It‚Äôs the same thing Oppenheimer used to\nmake this thing go boom. You see, there‚Äôs two main ways to gain energy\nfrom changing nuclei: Fission and Fusion. Fission aims to split the nucleus of an atom\ninto two or more smaller nuclei, which is most often achieved by blasting the core with\nneutrons. Fusion is the opposite, where you combine\ntwo smaller nuclei to get one bigger one. The energy came from something we call a ‚Äúmass\ndefect‚Äù where the resulting nucleus is lighter than the starting nuclei. This ‚Äúmissing‚Äù mass is what was converted\nto energy during Fusion. Fission and Fusion are cool, but you have\ngot to be careful or you might just blow up the planet. That totally didn‚Äôt almost happen before‚Ä¶multiple\ntimes. Hey remember when Einstein said light is a\nparticle? He accidentally discovered a whole new field\nof physics which he though is just a giant hoax: Quantum Mechanics. This stuff is crazy. Another german guy called Max Planck said\n‚Äúyes, Einstein, you‚Äôre right. Light does come in tiny packets. Actually, all energy comes in tiny packets‚Äù. Or ‚ÄúQuanta‚Äù. He is the daddy of Quantum Mechanics. Wanna know where an electron is inside an\natom? It‚Äôs here! And there! And everywhere, at the same time, actually! That‚Äôs a superposition. It‚Äôs not in one state, it‚Äôs in multiple\nstates at once - at least until you measure it. Then it chooses one cozy spot to be in. Schr√∂dinger gave us an equation that gives\nyou a probabilistic model of where you can find it if you were to measure. You can imagine this as a cloud, and the denser\nit is, the more likely it is for an electron to be there. But still, where exactly it will end up once\nyou measure it, is random. Speaking of observing particles, they‚Äôre\nalso super sensitive about their private data. Look at these two images of a flying ball:\nin one, you can clearly see where the ball is, but not in which direction it‚Äôs moving,\nand in the other you can see where it‚Äôs moving and approximately how fast, but not\nwhere exactly it is at the moment. That is essentially Heisenberg‚Äôs uncertainty\nprinciple: You can never know both the exact position and the exact speed of a quantum\nparticle at the same time. Okay, let‚Äôs recap, a small thing can be\na particle and a wave at the same time, and when we try to look at them, weird stuff happens. But you know what, it gets even weirder. Think back to the double slit experiment:\nWe know that a light beam acts as a bunch of waves and we get interference. But here‚Äôs the weird thing: Even if you\nsend individual photons, after sending enough of them and detecting where they end up, you\nget interference. Like, how can that be? What did a single particle interfere with? Well, we think it interfered with itself,\nbecause it acted as a wave and went through both slits at the same time. That‚Äôs a superposition. ‚ÄúOkay, well let‚Äôs just measure which slit\nit goes through‚Äù. Uh, yeah, that‚Äôs not going to happen. Once you start measuring which slit the photon\ngoes through, it stops acting like a wave and the interference pattern disappears, as\nevery particle chooses just one of the slits to go through. Sounds kinda suspicious to me. Anyways, all this knowledge is going to cost\nyou one subscribe and a thumbs up, thank you very much, and you can decide if maybe you‚Äôd\nwant to tip with a comment, perhaps?"

        "transcription": "I didn't plan on becoming particle physicists enemy number one, but that's what I've been for the past years. Now that this time is almost over, I hope I want to try and explain what happened and how I think we can make progress in the foundations of physics. Spoiler alert, not by building bigger particle colliders. I believe that many of you heard of me first because I was criticizing particle physicists plans for a bigger collider among other places in the New York Times. Here are some of the reaction from particle physicists. Seriously, you. This person does not need this kind of soapbox. I find your comments respectless. It would be a good idea for you to leave basic research. You do not have the spirit needed. It is one thing to no longer be able or want to continue to do physics research. Quite another to foul one's own exest in public. If you were wondering why there are so few physicists who draw attention to the problems with their own discipline, this illustrates the problem. Physicists are not exactly welcoming off criticism. But I didn't just wake up one day and decided to crap on particle physicists. I swear it's not what happened. I'd spent the previous 15 years trying to understand why the foundations of physics stopped making progress in the 1980s. I believe then and I still believe today that I know why. Physics is one of the oldest disciplines of science and as a research area matures it becomes more difficult to find new observations that don't fit into the existing theories. They become increasingly removed from our everyday experience. Experiments become more difficult, larger, more expensive. As a consequence, serendipitous discoveries become incredibly unlikely. You don't coincidentally discover a hix boson. It took decades and billions of dollars to build a machine that could do it. The time of serendipitous discoveries in physics is over. But without new discoveries, we can't confirm new theories, and so progress slows down. This is what you'd expect. Indeed, that progress has stored per se isn't the origin of my worry. That progress slows as scientific disciplines develop is normal to some extent. No, my primary worry is the seemingly endless stream of wrong predictions that physicists have put forward and continue to put forward. You see, we don't have infinite resources. And if experiments become expensive, we must decide very carefully which ones to do. What happened in the foundations of physics is simply that physicists have been extremely careless. They've been throwing billions of dollars at useless experiments that didn't get us anywhere. This is why progress has stopped. For almost 50 years, they built new experiments because they wanted to test some shiny new theories. Ideas like grand unified theories that predicted proton decay, super symmetry that predicted all sorts of new particles, extra dimensions that predicted black holes at the Large Hadron Collider, and many other things. They didn't find any of those. Why? Because these ideas are mathematical fiction. They're not proper science. In the foundations of physics, you find tens of thousands of such predictions for stuff that they just made up. And this story isn't over. It's still going on as we speak. They're now talking about entire dark sectors of particles that you can't measure. And a new branch of nonsense production that I have to talk about more at some point is all sorts of modified gravities. The archive is now full of those. But we know that historically new theories in physics have been successful if they solved a problem with the existing theories. The physicists at the time often didn't know this. All right. But it's evident if you looked at what worked and what didn't work. A new theory in physics needs to solve a problem. either an internal problem in the theories like Einstein's theories did or how the Higs boson did or attention with experiments like quantum physics did. The new ideas are not of this type. Axion, super symmetry, grand unification, extra dimensions and hundreds of dark matter particles and weird fields. They don't solve any problems. They only solve problems that physicists have made up in the first place. These so-called problems are all aesthetic misgivings about the current theories and so based on historical precedents. This means that the new theories are very unlikely to be correct. This is a conclusion that I arrived at a few years after my PhD. Theoretical physicists and the foundations are using the wrong methods of theory development. The methods that they currently use have zero chance of succeeding by the current standard. There are infinitely many theories that are acceptable. So the chance that any one of them is correct is one over infinity. You can see new examples of this almost every day in some press releases where some group of physicists put forward a new theory for dark matter or for the big bang or some supposed modification of black holes. None of those are solving any problem. They are all vanish in the big toilet flush of published literature. It's incredibly tiresome that this insanity is still going on. And because I became convinced that the methods that physicists use to make these so-called predictions can't work, I concluded that neither the LHC nor the existing dark matter experiments would find anything of interest. And neither would a bigger particle collider after that. This is why I stopped working on LHC physics in 2005 before the LHC even turned on. In 2006, I turned down a very well-funded grant, the aminota grant of the German Research Foundation because that would have required me to continue working on beyond the standard model physics at the LHC, which I had concluded is all nonsense. It was my own mistake to some extent. I shouldn't have applied for funding on a topic I didn't think was worthwhile. But you see the problem. If I had applied for a topic that I actually thought was worth researching, I wouldn't have gotten the grant. In any case, I turned it down. I might well be the only person in the history of that grant who ever turned it down. The university couldn't believe it. They thought it was a mistake. My friends told me I'm nuts. I accepted instead an offer from Pyrama Institute, which was objectively far worse. The only person who didn't question my sanity was my mother who simply said, \"You know what you're doing.\" But well, I wasn't so sure. You see, there was in my late 20s with that great insight about how current theory development in physics is all nonsense. And then there were some 10,000 intelligent people who thought otherwise. Whom would you have trusted? Me or the 10,000 geniuses? Well, I certainly didn't trust myself. It didn't help that at the time I had serious mental health problems and I couldn't exclude the possibility that I'm just not right in the hell. I know this sounds like a joke, but it isn't. If you've ever had a mental health problem, you'll know what I'm talking about. You can't trust your own judgment. So, I considered this. I'm probably wrong. I might be crazy, but in the end, I still didn't want to waste my time on what I thought was nonsense research. That would certainly not have benefited my mental health either. So, I went to Pyrama Institute and started working on something else. That didn't go well either, but that's another story which shall be told another time. But I kept track of what was going on in particle physics. The LHC turned on. It found the Higs boson that was the last remaining good prediction from before the nonsense era. It ruled out all the pseudo predictions as I expected. And then particle physicists started moving their predictions. They started saying, \"Ah, it'll just take longer to find these things. We'll find it in a few years or after the upgrade and then we'll find it with the next bigger collider.\" You don't have to take my word for this. It's all documented in the published literature. That was in 2015. And that was when I decided to write my book, Lost in Math. In that book, I explained why these predictions were almost certain to also be ruled out and why physicists need to step back and think about what's going wrong in their discipline. Because this isn't normal. It isn't normal for scientists to produce wrong predictions for decades and just continue doing this. Something is very very wrong here. I still believe that I made a good argument by saying we should focus on inconsistencies, but all I got was insults and not because of the argument itself, but because of the conclusion that it led to a bigger particle collider is a waste of money. Particle physicists, meanwhile, doubled down on their stories, which got wilder and wilder. The new big mega collider that CERN wanted to build would allegedly test dark matter. It would test dark energy. It would tell us how the universe began. And so each time a particle physicist went and promoted nonsense like this, I was there to explain why it's nonsense. I know why particle physicists hate me. But what was I supposed to do? Look away and just let them deceive the public? Someone had to do it? One day, the head of my institute received a call from a small group of people who said they're physicists at CERN. They requested that I be fired. This story has been communicated to me by the person who got the call. I can't confirm that it's true, but I see no reason why he should have made it up, and it seems plausible. I've also personally had to deal with particle physicists who yelled at me during talks, after talks, and of course on social media. Almost all of these attacks were personal. They were about me, not my argument. They'd say, \"Zabini just wants to sell books, which, yeah, I want to, but my book wasn't about son's collidider plant. So, I recommend you buy 10 copies and burn them. Trust me, you'll feel much better afterwards. They'd say Sabina is bitter because she isn't tenured. But I stopped pursuing tenure long before any of that happened for personal reasons. And I'm not bitter. I'm a happier person today because I didn't give in and smoozed with the nonsense producers. Though it's right that if I had been tenured, I'd almost certainly have kept my mouth shut about that bigger collider. They'd say, \"I just want attention.\" I don't want attention, at least not for myself. I just want to draw attention to the problem that I see. If I could have done all of this anonymously, I would have much preferred this. I actually asked my agent about it, but he said no one would publish the book without my name on it. If you wonder how I cope with knowing that a 100,000 people or so might watch this, denial. None of you is real. I'm probably not real either. Sometimes having a few loose screws in your head is actually a benefit. More seriously, if that's not what Sabina wants, then what does Sabina want? I just want them to think about what I'm saying because the future of physics depends on it. And the future of science depends on the future of physics and the future of our civilizations depends on the future of science. I believe I take the foundations of physics much more seriously than anyone else I know with the possible exception of Eric Weinstein. But that's another story that shall be told another time. And this is the reason why I'm opposed to building this bigger particle collider. It would be a disaster for the foundations of physics. It would stall progress for another 50 years. It would take up a lot of money. would encourage people to produce more nonsense theories. It would do next to nothing for society and it almost certainly wouldn't find anything of interest for anyone besides particle physicists. What we should do instead is focus on experiments in areas where we either have an internal inconsistency in the theories like in quantum gravity or an existing inconsistency between data and theory like in astrophysics. Why, for example, do we not have a billion dollar research program for experimentally testing quantum gravity? This, by all reasonable measures, be a considerably better investment. I also worry a lot that there is so little research on the foundations of quantum physics. It seems entirely possible to me that with all the quantum technology developments going on, there is a physics breakthrough hidden in the data already. But we don't know about it because we have no theory that tells us what to even look for in the data. There are a bunch of standard arguments that particle physicists usually bring up in favor of their big collider. I actually wrote a list for this about 6 years ago to which I'll leave you a link below. I got one of the most idiotic arguments in reply to my New York Times opad from particle physicist Lisa Randelle. It's what I call the money is wasted elsewhere too argument. In Randall's case, colliders are expensive, but so was the government shutdown. It's an idiotic argument because it admits the particle physics is a waste of money. Lisa Randelle, by the way, got tenured for coming up with an idea for extra dimensions, of which no one has ever seen any evidence. I don't want to pick on her specifically. She's the product of an insane pseudocientific research trend. The people who are trapped in this for the most part don't understand it isn't proper science. In any case, almost all of the arguments that particle physicists make for a bigger collider actually have nothing to do with that collider. They're instead arguments for some large science project. Any such large project would you know have a chance of spin-offs benefit technological developments and adjacent areas make a contribution to education and so on and that's all well and good but if you want to invest into education then just do that you don't need to also dig a 91 kilometer tunnel along with it well as I just said the other day I think that at this point CERN's large collider plans have small chances of succeeding partly because of the general eneral economic situation in Europe. I may be wrong because particle physicists have an extremely influential lobby among politicians. So, I'm not totally counting them out yet. But what has become clear to me is that if not particle physicists, then a lot of other people now understand the problem with nonsense research in the foundations. So, I'm cautiously hopeful that maybe, just maybe, I'll see progress in my lifetime. If this video inspired you to solve some big physics problems, a great way to start is with Brilliant.

        "transcription": "in this video we're going to cover some basic concepts such as displacement velocity acceleration projectile motion newton's three laws forces momentum and things like that so for those of you who want a basic intro into physics and just want to understand some principle ideas involving physics this video is for you so let's begin the first thing we're going to talk about is distance and displacement now many of you out there are very familiar with the word distance when you think of distance when you hear the word distance what do you think of i think of how far something has traveled so let's say the distance between one city to another could be a hundred miles and so is the the difference between two points now displacement is very similar to distance but displacement encompasses direction as well direction is important for displacement so let me give an example that distinguishes distance and displacement so let's say if you have a person let's say john and he's at this position right here and he decides to walk let's say eight meters east and then he turns in the other direction and travels let's say three meters west the total distance that john travels is eight plus three or eleven meters however his displacement is not eleven but rather his displacement is five meters displacement is the difference between the final position and the initial position so let's say if we have a number line and let's say this is position zero so john traveled eight meters east so now he's at position eight on a number line so during the first part of his trip his displacement was positive eight then he traveled three meters west so his displacement is negative three so now he's at position five and so his net displacement is five meters because he started from position a and now he's at position b which is located at position five and so your net displacement is basically it's the final position let's say pf minus the initial position his final position is position five his initial position is zero so his displacement is positive five he went from a to b and so that's the basic idea behind displacement the total distance is 11. now distance is a scalar quantity it only has magnitude displacement is a vector quantity it has both magnitude and direction in the case of distance in the first part of the trip he traveled a distance of positive eight in the second part he traveled a distance of positive three and so the total distance is 11 meters now displacement has the magnitude and direction during the first part of his trip his displacement was positive eight the magnitude is how far he traveled which is eight meters the direction is he's traveling east and so we have a positive sign for going in an eastward direction anytime you go towards the right you're going in the positive x direction so the displacement is positive now during the second part of the trip he's traveling west that is towards the negative x direction and so it's negative 3 in terms of displacement but in terms of distance it's positive 3. keep this in mind distance is always positive but displacement can be positive or negative if you're traveling east or north displacement has a positive value if you're traveling west or south displacement has a negative value and so if you add up the displacement for the first part of the trip plus the displacement of the second part you get the net displacement of positive five positive eight plus negative three will give you positive five now let's say a car travels 200 miles would this description be related to distance or displacement so if i say you travel 200 miles am i describing distance or displacement well this would be a description of distance because no direction was indicated so you could be going east west north or south if you simply state 200 miles you're describing distance now let's say if the car traveled 300 miles north in this case i have the magnitude which is 300 miles and i also have the direction which is in the norfolk direction so in this case i'm describing displacement displacement is a vector quantity it has both magnitude and direction whereas a distance is a scalar quantity it only has magnitude such as 200 miles without any direction so make sure you understand the difference between a scalar quantity and a vector quantity a scalar quantity as we said before has magnitude only but a vector quantity has a magnitude and direction now let's talk about speed when you think of the word speed what do you think of speed tells you how fast something is moving so let's say if a car is traveling 30 meters per second what does that mean so that means that every second the car will have traveled a distance of 30 meters so let's say this is the starter line and i'm going to use a box to represent a car and the car is moving in this direction with a speed of 30 meters per second so one second later the car will have traveled a total distance of 30 meters two seconds later it's going to travel another distance of 30 meters so for a total distance of 60 meters so we can make a table so let's put t for time d for distance so if the speed is 30 meters per second so every second the distance traveled will increase by 30. and so that's what speed tells us it tells us how fast the distance of an object or the distance traveled by an object is changing every second so let's say if you're driving a car and you're going 60 miles per hour every hour at that speed you will travel a distance of 60 miles so let's say if you want to travel a distance of 300 miles it's gonna take you five hours to do so in the first hour you're gonna travel 60 miles in the second hour you have covered a distance of 120 miles so every hour you're going to travel an additional distance of 60 miles now there's a formula that you need to know and it's d is equal to vt in this equation d can be used as a distance and v represents speed t represents time now sometimes with this formula you could use the velocity in terms of v and if you do so then d will no longer technically be represented by distance but it's going to be represented by displacement and so you could use that simple formula in many different ways so here's a question for you so let's say if you have an object that is moving at a speed of let's say 50 meters per second how long will it take for this object to travel a distance of 1000 meters so we're looking for the time how long so we could use this formula d is equal to vt so the distance is a thousand meters v is 50 meters per second and we need to calculate the time so we can divide both sides by 50. and so it's going to be a thousand divided by 50. if we cancel a zero that's a hundred divided by 5 which is 20. so it's going to take 20 seconds for this object to travel a distance of a thousand meters now let's talk about speed and velocity so what is the difference between these two quantities because they both describe how fast something is moving but there's a difference between them speed is a scalar quantity and velocity is a vector quantity speed is always positive velocity can be positive or negative now recall that a scalar quantity only has magnitude whereas a vector quantity has magnitude and direction so can you think of some examples that will distinguish speed from velocity so let's say if a train i'm going to use a box again is moving at 45 meters per second let me take away the arrow so i you don't have any direction it's simply moving at 45 meters per second in this case this describes the speed of the train because i'm telling you how fast it's moving but not where it's going now let's say if we have a train moving at 30 meters per second going west in this case this is a description of velocity because not only do you have the magnitude of the vector which is the speed but you also have the direction and so when you combine magnitude and direction you have a vector quantity and so velocity is basically speed with direction the 30 meters per second tells you the speed wes tells you the direction and when you combine these two you have velocity so let's summarize a few key points speed tells you how fast something is moving velocity tells you not only how fast something is moving but also where it is going so remember velocity is speed with direction speed can only be positive velocity can be positive or negative so if v is negative 20 meters per second you know you're dealing with velocity because it's negative if you're looking for the speed the speed would be positive 20 meters per second speed is always positive and you could say this speed is the absolute value of velocity velocity can be positive or negative but speed is always positive so if the velocity was negative 35 meters per second the speed is automatically positive 35 meters per second now there are some mathematical formulas that you want to know when dealing with speed and velocity there's something called average speed because sometimes in physics you need to calculate the average speed of an object the average speed can be calculated by taking the total distance traveled by the object and dividing it by the total time now if you think about this formula d is equal to vt v can be described as the speed or the velocity so if you divide both sides by t you could cancel this on the right side you'll see that v which is the average speed in this case is equal to d over t so average speed v is equal to the total distance d divided by the total time t now what about average velocity let's say if we wish to calculate average velocity how can we do so average velocity is equal to displacement divided by the total time so in this case the formula looks the same average velocity could be represented by v displacement can be represented by d and the time is t so the formula looks identical but the meaning is different so keep this in mind velocity is associated with displacement speed is associated with distance now let's say if you have an object and this object traveled 12 meters east and then it travels 20 meters west and it did so in a time period a total time period of four seconds so let's say going from position a to position b that's a distance of 12 meters and from position b to position c 20 meters so that total trip from a to c took only four seconds so for this object going from a to c what is the average speed of the object and also what is the average velocity so to calculate the average speed we need to determine the total distance and divide it by the total time the total distance is simply 12 plus 20. if you add those two numbers it will give you 32 meters and the total time is 4 seconds so 32 divided by 4 is 8. so the average speed is positive 8. keep in mind speed is always positive now what about the average velocity well we know that average velocity is defined as displacement divided by the total time the displacement for the first part of the trip going from a to b is positive 12 because the object is traveling in the positive x direction the object is going east for the second part of the trip the object is traveling west towards the negative x direction and so going from b to c the displacement is negative so if we add up 12 and negative 20 we can get the net displacement which is negative eight now keep in mind you can also treat this as a number line let's say a is at position 0 b will be at position 12 and then if you do 12 minus 20 you'll see that c is at position negative 8. and the difference between these two positions will be the net displacement which is still negative eight so the final position minus the initial position will give you the net displacement now let's divide it by four seconds so the average velocity is negative two meters per second and it makes sense because the net result is that the person traveled in the in the westward direction towards the negative x-axis so going from a to c ignoring b the person traveled towards the west and that's why the velocity is negative because any time you're going in the west direction towards the negative x-axis it will be negative if you're going towards the positive x-axis or in the eastward direction it's going to be positive now let's talk about acceleration what is acceleration now you've encountered acceleration when driving a car a good way to think about it is imagine two vehicles let's say a truck i'm not the most artistic person but we'll work with this and let's say a sports car which of these two vehicles have let's say a greater acceleration is it the truck or the sports car so what is acceleration acceleration tells you how fast the speed is changing or more technically how fast the velocity is changing so the truck can probably go from zero to 60 miles and maybe let's say 30 seconds a sports car can go from 0 to 60 in a shorter period of time let's say in 5 seconds so because the sports car can get to a higher speed or to a certain speed faster than the truck it has a greater acceleration and so acceleration tells you how fast the velocity is changing acceleration is defined as the change in velocity divided by the change in time or sometimes you could just put t so you can write it this way let me adjust the formula so if you see the triangle it simply means change so acceleration can be written this way it's the final velocity minus the initial velocity divided by the time so to calculate the acceleration of the truck notice that the change in velocity is 60 60 minus zero is 60 divided by the time which is 30. so 60 divided by 30 is 2. so the acceleration of this truck is 2 miles per hour per second because we divided miles per hour by seconds so it's miles per hour per second now the acceleration of the sports car is 60 miles per hour that's the change in velocity divided by five seconds 60 divided by 5 is 12. so it's 12 miles per hour per second as you can see the acceleration of the sports car is much greater than the acceleration of the truck the truck is going to take a long time to go from 0 to 60 but the sports car will get there a lot faster and so it has a greater acceleration and so that's the basic idea behind acceleration it tells you how fast the velocity is changing now let's make a table let's say if an object is moving with an initial speed of 12 meters per second so vo tells you initial speed or initial velocity now since i have an arrow let's say it's going east this now is it becomes the description of velocity if i put direction with it and let's say at this point this object or vehicle begins to accelerate at a rate of 4 meters per second squared so this is 4 meters per second per second so what does that mean so if we make a table if we plot time and velocity let's say the final velocity at a certain time at t equals 0 this becomes the initial velocity so it's 12. what would the velocity be one second later well the acceleration tells us how fast the velocity is changing so because the acceleration is positive 4 that means that the velocity is increasing by 4 meters per second every second so anytime acceleration is positive the velocity is increasing any time the acceleration is negative the velocity is decreasing so one second later the velocity will now be 16. two seconds later the velocity is 20. three seconds later it's 24 four seconds later it's 28 and so every second the velocity will increase by 4 meters per second because the acceleration is 4 meters per second per second now the formula that you want to use to calculate final velocity is this equation v final is equal to v initial plus 80. now let's say we have another object that is moving in an eastward direction at a speed of let's say 24 meters per second but this time let's say the acceleration is negative 6 meters per second squared what's going on here is this object speeding up or slowing down whenever the acceleration and velocity whenever they have opposite signs the object is slowing down whenever they have the same sign it's speeding up in the last example the acceleration was positive 4 and the velocity had positive values it started with positive 12 and so because velocity and acceleration have the same sign the object was speeding up so you may want to write this down the object will be speeding up that is the speed will be increasing if acceleration and velocity have the same signs if they're both positive or if they're both negative the object will be slowing down if the acceleration and velocity have opposite signs either positive and negative or negative and positive and this example will illustrate that so this time we're going to make a table with time velocity and i'm going to use s for speed or sp for speed so at t equals 0 the velocity is positive 24. and remember speed is the absolute value of velocity so the speed is positive 24. now one second later what will be the new velocity well the acceleration is negative six and recall that if acceleration is negative the velocity will be decreasing so it's going to decrease by six so 24 minus 6 is 18. two seconds later it will be 12. three seconds later it's going to be six four seconds later it's zero five seconds later it's negative six and then so forth now speed is always positive it's the absolute value of velocity so here the speed is positive 18 positive 12 positive 6 0 positive 6 positive 12 and so forth now let's focus on the first half in the first four seconds the object is slowing down if you look at the speed the speed is decreasing from 24 to zero so what's happening is that the object is moving but over time it's moving slower and slower and slower and so at four seconds at that instant is not moving however it's changing direction notice the velocity it's going from positive to negative which means that it's changing from an eastward direction to a westward direction and it begins to move faster towards the west so as you can see it's speeding up because the speed is increasing after four seconds now remember what we said before if acceleration and velocity if they share the same sign then the object will be speeded up that is if they're both positive or both negative but if they have opposite signs then the object is slowing down so during the first four seconds the velocity is positive and the acceleration is always negative therefore because the signs are opposite it's slowing down the speed is decreasing from 24 to zero now during the second part of this problem that is after four seconds the velocity is negative and the acceleration is negative so because they share the same sign the object is speeding up as you can see the speed increases from 0 to positive 18 in the next 3 seconds so make sure you understand that concept if acceleration and velocity share the same sign the object is speeded up if they have opposite signs it's slowing down now let's move on to gravitational acceleration in physics you'll see this symbol that looks like a g and it's equal to negative 9.8 meters per second squared so this is the gravitational acceleration of planet earth and it varies for different planets and other very large objects so the gravitational acceleration of the moon for example is negative 1.6 meters per second squared it's a lot less for one reason the moon has less mass than the earth and so you will weigh a lot less on the moon you'll feel lighter on the moon and so you can jump higher on the moon but let's focus on the gravitational acceleration of the earth negative 9.8 what does that mean well in the last example we saw what a negative acceleration can do to velocity and so the fact that this gravitational acceleration is negative means that it will always decrease the velocity now the gravitational acceleration of the earth it acts in the y direction and not in the x direction and so let's talk about velocity velocity is a vector and it can have an x component and it can have a y component the actual velocity is basically the hypotenuse of this right triangle v x is the horizontal component of this velocity vector v y is the vertical component the gravitational acceleration does not affect v x it affects v y so technically you can write this as g y it's a vertical gravitational acceleration it doesn't affect the horizontal velocity it affects the vertical velocity so make sure you understand that now let's use an example to help us understand g y sometimes it could be written as a y so a y and g are basically the same it's negative 9.8 let's say we have a person who is standing on top of a cliff next to the ocean and this person has a ball in his hand and he released the ball from rest so he doesn't throw it down or throw it up he simply lets go of the ball well we know what's going to happen gravity is going to cause the ball to fall now what can you tell me about v y the vertical velocity of the ball over time will it become positive or negative we know that velocity is speed with direction and right now the ball is going to be moving in the negative y direction so this is positive x this is negative x positive y negative y it's going down in the negative y direction so v y will become negative if we make a table with t and v y at t equals zero the initial vertical velocity will be zero because the ball was released from rest now the acceleration or also called acceleration due to gravity is negative 9.8 because it's negative the vertical velocity will be decreasing so every second it's going to decrease by 9.8 so two seconds later it's going to be negative 19.6 three seconds later it's negative 29.4 now the speed is always going to be positive so if you were asked what is the speed of the ball let's say three seconds later it's going to be positive 29.4 meters per second but if a test question asks you for let's say the velocity of the ball three seconds later you should say it's negative 29.4 meters per second because it's going in the negative y direction and so hopefully this number makes more sense so the gravitational acceleration tells you how fast the vertical velocity is changing every second so on the moon where a g is negative 1.6 if you were to drop a ball the vertical velocity will decrease by 1.6 meters per second every second so let's say we have a similar situation we have the same person with the ball in his hand and this time he throws it in the upward direction with an initial speed of 29.4 meters per second what can you tell me about the vertical velocity and its values every second and let's say this person is still on the earth where g is negative 9.8 meters per second squared so even though right now the velocity is positive because g is negative the vertical velocity will decrease so as the ball goes upward it's slowing down because the velocity is positive and the acceleration is negative because they're opposite in sign the ball is slowing down eventually the ball will reach its maximum height and then it's going to change direction and begin to fall down so if we make a table between t and v y we're going to get the following values so at t equals 0 that is initially the vertical velocity is positive 29.4 now the acceleration tells us how fast or how much the velocity changes every second so one second later it's going to decrease by 9.8 so 29.4 minus 9.8 will give us 19.6 so one second later it's going to be positive 19.6 two seconds later we need to decrease this again by 9.8 so it's going to be positive 9.8 three seconds later it's going to be at zero so when the vertical velocity is at zero that means that it's no longer going up anymore and it's not going down yet it has reached its maximum height so it took three seconds to get to its maximum height so let's call this position a position b and position c so once he is zero it's at position a when t is three is that position uh b four seconds later it's going to be negative 9.8 5 seconds later negative 19.6 6 seconds later negative 29.4 and so forth and so once it gets to position b once it passes that position the velocity will be negative because it's now going in the downward direction or in the negative y direction so that's the mathematical profile of this situation so now you understand what's happening to the velocity values as time progresses so time the acceleration is negative the velocity is decreasing as you can see it started with a positive value and now it's becoming negative now the next topic that you want to be familiar with is something called projectile motion so what is a projectile a projectile is basically an object that is moving under the influence of gravity so in the last two examples the ball that was released from rest and the ball that was thrown upward were behaving as projectiles because once released they were under the influence of gravity and in a typical physics course when dealing with projectile motion friction is usually ignored and so we're not going to talk about it here so far we've considered one dimensional projectile motion that is in the y direction the first case was a ball going straight down the second case was the ball going up and then down so it's one dimensional because it's only one direction in this case the y direction but let's talk about projectile motion in two dimensions that is in the x and in the y direction so one example that you'll see is a ball being kicked off a cliff or rolling off a cliff initially it's moving in the x direction and then it falls down like this and so the path that the ball travels is known as the trajectory hopefully i said that right trajectory but now let's say the ball was kicked off the cliff at a speed of let's say five meters per second so what can you tell me about the vertical and horizontal components of the velocity of the ball at different times so let's make a table between t v x and v y so initially at when t is zero v x is positive five because at that instant it's moving only in the horizontal direction so if you look at the trajectory this line is only going to the right it's not going up or down it's just going to the right now the vertical velocity is zero because it's not it doesn't have any component in the y direction now one second later let's say the ball is over here so now the ball is moving in this direction so the velocity can be broken up into its x component so it's still moving to the right and the y component it's moving down so let's call this point a and at point b so at point b because it's going in this direction it has a v x value and a v y value and let's say point b is one second later from point a so point a t is zero and at point b t is one so what is the velocity at point b and what is the velocity at point c let's say where t is 2 2 seconds one second later we know what v y is going to be due to gravitational acceleration the vertical velocity will decrease by 9.8 every second so two seconds later it will be negative 19.6 three seconds later negative 29.4 now what about vx now it's important to understand that g negative 9.8 is a vertical acceleration not a horizontal acceleration it's not a y i mean it's not a x but it's a y so this number does not affect the v axe so when dealing with projectile motion unless this ball have some rocket thrusters vx is constant it doesn't change so for projectile motion the acceleration in the horizontal direction is zero so unless there's some some kind of force that's propelling the ball to the right that is after it's been kicked ax is zero so it's important to keep that in mind and if a x is zero that means that v x does not change if the acceleration is zero the velocity is not changing the velocity is constant so to summarize what we've learned here when dealing with projectile motion it's important to understand that the velocity in the x direction v x is constant it doesn't change unless the problem states that there's something accelerating it in a horizontal direction if there's no specific statement as such a x is zero and v x is constant but for any projectile motion problem v y changes v y is going to change by 9.8 every second here is another projectile motion situation let me start at the bottom so let's say we have a ball and the ball is kicked off the ground at an angle it goes up and then it goes down now typically you might be given the velocity at which is kicked let's say it's going up at a speed of 40 meters per second and let's say it's at an angle of 30. so you have v which is 40 and you have the angle theta which is 30 degrees now what you need to do is find v x and v y v x is basically v cosine theta and this is the initial value v y is v sine theta now for this problem i'm going to give you v x and v y so we're going to choose some different values but in a typical problem when you're given v and theta you can find v x and v y by using those formulas but let's say that you discover initially the v x is let's use a nice number eight meters per second and v y we're going to say is 29.4 meters per second so that's at a time value of zero what's going to happen one second later so one second later what's going to happen to v x and v y now it's important to understand that v x will not change for projectile motion gravity does not affect vx it affects v y so one second later v x will still be eight meters per second v y is going to decrease by 9.8 meters per second every second gravitational acceleration affects v y but not v x so this is going to be 19.6 one second later now two seconds later vx will still be the same and that's eight meters per second v y is now 9.8 three seconds later it's at the top at the maximum height at the highest point v y is zero so it's not going up anymore but it's still moving to the right so it's still moving at eight meters per second to the right so that's v x now four seconds later what do you think is going to happen well v x is still the same it's still eight meters per second but now it's going down so v y is negative 9.8 and then five seconds later v x is still the same but v y is now negative 19.6 and six seconds later v y is going to be negative 29.4 so notice that the speed is the same when the height is the same if the trajectory is symmetrical in this case the left side looks exactly the same as the right side so there's symmetry for this type of shape so at a certain height v y has the same magnitude but the opposite side this is positive 19.6 and that's a negative 19.6 so the velocities just have opposite signs but speed in either case is still positive 19.6 so the speed is the same when the height is the same but v x doesn't change in the typical projectile motion problem only v y changes based on the gravitational acceleration now let's talk about newton's three laws so let's go over the first law the basic idea behind newton's first law of motion is that an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by a force and an object in motion will continue in motion unless acted on by a net force so let's say if we have a box and it's at rest it's not moving the only way we can get this box to move is by applying a force and a force is a push or pull action so in this case the force is pushing the box towards the right we can also get the box to move towards the right if we take a rope and pull the rope towards the right so here this is a push action and towards the right it's a pull action and the way to pull something is by means of a rope whenever you have a force acting on a rope it's known as a tension force so whenever you hear the word tension it's basically a force acting through a rope so unless we apply a force the box at rest will continue to remain at rest now let's say we have a box and this box is moving to the right so it's sliding across the surface the only way to stop the box from moving in this direction is to apply a force in the opposite direction and friction will do that too so if you try to slide a box across a rough surface you know the box is going to come to a stop because friction will oppose the box for moving friction always opposes motion it tends to slow things down and so thus we have newton's first law an object in motion will continue in motion unless acted on by a force so if there was no friction this box will continue to slide forever but because friction is present and it's opposite to the direction of the velocity of the box it's going to slow it down and bring it to rest so if that force wasn't present it will keep moving so if you think of objects moving in outer space where there's almost no friction those objects tend to basically move forever so if you think of the earth as it revolves around the sun the earth moves in a vacuum of space is basically almost no air in space and so that there's hardly any friction thus it can move forever around the sun without any or hardly any assistance a good way to illustrate this is imagine if we take an object and let's say like a puck if you're playing air hockey and if we slide it across ice because there's not much friction between this object and ice because ice has a very smooth surface this object will travel for a very long time because there's not much friction between the ice and this object whereas let's say if you have the same object across a rough surface this object will not slide very far it's going to come to a stop quickly because it's more friction and so if you could reduce friction the object will travel for a very long time and if you can completely eliminate friction then by newton's first law of motion it should continue forever so an object in motion will continue emotion unless acted on by a force now let's talk about newton's second law and the best way to summarize newton's second law of motion is through this equation the net force of an object is equal to the mass times the acceleration and sometimes you'll see the term net force or in this way as with a summation symbol or sigma and this could be the net force in the y direction or the net force in the x direction nevertheless just make sure you understand that the net force is basically the mass times the acceleration so here's the question for you let's say if i have a 10 kilogram mass and it rests across a horizontal surface and let's say there's no friction and i apply a force of 80 newtons what is the acceleration of the box so f equals m a the force is 80 newtons the mass is 10 kilograms what is a so a is going to be 80 divided by 10 which is 8. so this box will accelerate at 8 meters per second squared so what does that tell us about the velocity of the box so every second the velocity of the box will increase by eight meters per second so if we make a table at t equals zero the velocity is zero when t is one the velocity is eight when t is two the velocity is 16 and so forth and so whenever you apply a force on an object you exert an acceleration on that object and as a result you're increasing the velocity of the object that object will begin to move at a faster pace"

        "transcription": "Everything is made of atoms. Yes, even you.\nAtoms consist of a core and some electrons. The core is made of protons and neutrons.\nAnd depending on the number of protons, you get different elements.\nWater is made of Hydrogen and Oxygen. This is some Sodium. Hm, I wonder what happens\nwhen you mix them‚Ä¶oh, whoopsie. Quantum mechanics tells us that this is not\nwhat atoms actually look like, they look more like this, but we‚Äôll get to that later.\nFor now, just think of atoms as having multiple electron ‚Äúshells‚Äù. The electrons in the\noutermost shell are called ‚Äúvalence electrons‚Äù. Most of chemistry is really just the behaviour\nof these electrons. Every element is listed in the periodic table.\nAll elements in the same column or ‚Äúgroup‚Äù have the same number of valence electrons.\nFor the main groups, the number of valence electrons is just the group number from 1\nto 8. Except for helium. It‚Äôs too small to have 8 electrons, it can only have 2. But\nstill, it acts like a noble gas, so it‚Äôs kind of just grouped in with those. Luckily,\nthe transition metals also follow a nice pattern! That was a lie, it‚Äôs kind of a mess. But\nthat‚Äôs not so important for now, so we‚Äôll get to that later.\nElements with the same number of valence electrons tend to show similar behaviour in chemical\nreactions. For example, the first group, without hydrogen, is called the ‚Äúalkali metals‚Äù.\nHere‚Äôs some things they have in common: They have one valence electron. They‚Äôre\nshiny metals. They‚Äôre kind of soft. And they do this sometimes.\nAll elements in the same row or ‚Äúperiod‚Äù have the same number of shells. This number\nincreases from top to bottom. Also, the mass gets bigger from left to right, as each element\ngains a proton, an electron and some neutrons. Depending on the number of neutrons in the\ncore, you get different isotopes of the same element, most of which are pretty unstable,\nand fall apart, releasing ionizing radiation. Fun fact! That stuff will kill you.\nIf an atom has the same amount of electrons as protons, it has no charge. If it has more,\nit has a negative charge, and if it has less, it has a positive charge. Charged atoms are\ncalled ‚Äúions‚Äù, negative ions are ‚Äúanions‚Äù and positive ions are ‚Äúcations‚Äù.¬† The periodic table is also¬†\npretty much a dictionary, as every cell tells you:\nThe name and symbol of an element, the number of protons in the core, which is also the\ntotal number of electrons and the atomic mass, which is the mass of neutrons and protons\ncombined. The periodic table is roughly divided into\nthree categories: Left of this line are the metals. Right of it are the non-metals, which\nare mostly gases, and the line is called the ‚Äúsemimetals‚Äù, which have properties that\nfall somewhere inbetween. Two or more atoms bonded together form a molecule.\nIf you have at least two different elements, you get a ‚Äúcompound‚Äù. Oh yeah, this is\nprobably a good time to mention that compounds often behave completely differently than the\nelements they‚Äôre made of. Like, put together an explosive metal and a toxic gas, and you\nget, of course, an even more explo- table salt. You get tablesalt.\nThere‚Äôs many ways to write molecules, for example the Molecular formula, where you just\ncount the number of each atom in a molecule, and write them as a subscript number next\nto the element symbol. But that has some problems. Look at these\ntwo molecules: They have the same molecular formula, but obviously, they‚Äôre not the\nsame. They‚Äôre isomers. Showing this difference is probably kind of\nimportant: It‚Äôs the only thing that separates graphite from diamonds, because they‚Äôre\nboth just fancy versions of carbon, and I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs going to go ‚Äúmmm,\nyes, this dusty black blob is indeed very expensive‚Äù.\nOne way to show the structure of an atom is a Lewis-Dot-Structure, which represents the\nvalence electrons and bonds as dots and lines. That is also going to help us understand why\natoms bond in the first place. You see, everything in the universe wants\nto get to a state of lower energy. That‚Äôs why a ball on a hill will roll down by itself,\nbecause that decreases its potential energy. This trend also applies to atoms: The state\nof lowest potential energy is having a full outer shell of electrons, which is most often\neight, or in the case of hydrogen and helium, two. If you think back to the periodic table,\nyou‚Äôll see that all noble gases already have a full outer shell, which is why they\ndon‚Äôt really want to react with anything. If two atoms don‚Äôt have a full outer shell,\nbut can achieve one by sharing electrons, they will naturally do so, the same way a\nball will go downhill, as their combined energy would be lower than if they were separate.\nThe sharing of electrons is called a ‚Äúcovalent bond‚Äù. These bonds are also caused by the\npositively charged nucleus of an atom tugging on electrons of another atom. The strength\nof this pull is called ‚Äúelectronegativity‚Äù. In the periodic table, the electronegativity\nincreases from bottom left to the top right. Therefore, Fluorine has the strongest pull.\nIt‚Äôs just, unbelievably desperate for an electron.\nIf the difference in electronegativity is bigger than about 1.7, you get an ionic bond.\nA good example is Sodium Chloride. Chlorine would do anything for an electron, while Sodium\nhas one too many and just kind of wants to get rid of it anyway. ‚ÄúPerfect!‚Äù they\nboth say, forming an ionic bond, where sodium loses an electron and turns into a cation,\nand chlorine gains an electron and turns into an anion. That seems pretty important‚Ä¶you\nmight wanna remember it. The most common place you see Ionic bonds\nis in salt, yes, also table salt, but more generally, when metals and nonmetals bond,\nyou get ‚Äúa‚Äù salt, which is just a grid of ions.\nSpeaking of metals, a pure metal forms ‚Äúmetallic bonds‚Äù. You can imagine this as a huge grid\nof the positively charged nuclei, which are surrounded by freely moving electrons. You\nsee, in a metal grid, the valence electrons are kind of promiscuous, or as nerds call\nit, ‚Äúdelocalized‚Äù. They can move freely in a giant playground of nuclei, instead of\nbeing loyal to just one. This kind of bond is¬†\nresponsible for the properties¬† of metals, like conducting electricity and heat, and also, being malleable, as in being\nkind of bendy. Like, you can hammer on this stuff until it‚Äôs the most deformed, unelegant\nand ugly looking piece of material ever known, and it will just limp along as if nothing\never happened. If the difference in electronegativity is\nlower than about 0.5, the electrons are shared pretty equally and you get a nonpolar covalent\nbond. If it‚Äôs bigger than 0.5 but smaller than around 1.7, one of the elements is pulling\non the electrons pretty hard. Not quite hard enough to completely steal an electron, but\ndefinitely hard enough to skew the electrons a bit, making it a polar covalent bond.\nAn example is water. Oxygen has a very high electronegativity compared to hydrogen. As\na result, it pulls the electrons of hydrogen so hard, that they kind of belong to oxygen,\ngiving it a partial negative charge, and leaving hydrogen with a partial positive charge. The\npresence of two poles with opposite charge is called a ‚Äúelectric dipole‚Äù.\nAll permanent dipole molecules can interact with each other, and really, with anything\nthat has a charge. As a result, the molecules will tug on each other and arrange themselves\nin a way that oppositely charged ends are next to each other. The forces acting between\nthem are called ‚Äúintermolecular forces‚Äù or IMFs.\nA specific example is hydrogen bonds, where hydrogen bonds to something very electronegative,\nlike Fluorine, Oxygen or Nitrogen, creating strong dipoles that tug on each other.\nBut even if molecules are not polar at all,¬† there can be electrostatic forces acting between them. How? Electrons move around inside atoms,\nand by pure chance they can end up on one side of the atom, creating a momentary dipole,\nwhich influences other particles next to it to become a dipole as well. At least for a\nvery short time, as the electrons keep moving and the dipole disappears. This is called\n‚ÄúVan der Waals forces‚Äù.¬† The polarity of water also explains why it‚Äôs one of the most versatile solvents to exist.\nIt can pull apart molecules by tugging on charges, and it keeps them apart by surrounding\na particle with its oppositely charged end. Water cannot dissolve nonpolar molecules though.\nIt‚Äôs the reason why water and oil don‚Äôt mix, since fat molecules are nonpolar, while\nwater is polar. Just remember the ancient saying: ‚ÄúSimilia\nSimilibus Solventur‚Äù, or in a language that‚Äôs\nactually spoken: similar¬†¬† things will dissolve\nsimilar things. Fun fact! Soap works because the molecules¬† that it‚Äôs made from, which¬†\nare called ‚Äúsurfactants‚Äù have a polar ‚Äúhead‚Äù, and a nonpolar ‚Äútail‚Äù.\nThis way, when in water, they can surround for example nonpolar fat molecules and form\n‚Äúmicelles‚Äù, which, along with the water, transport the dirt particles away.\nThese are the most important bonds and forces ranked by strength: [Ionic Bonds, Covalent\nBonds, Metallic Bonds, Hydrogen Bonds, Van der Waals Forces] There are three main states of matter: Solid,\nliquid and gas. Solids are tightly packed in a fixed structures,\nwhere the particles can only wiggle. Unless, you know, you smash them. In liquids, the\nparticles can move freely but are still confined to a fixed volume, as the forces between them\nare still strong enough to keep them together, and the particles in gases have enough energy\nto just do whatever they want and fill up all the volume you give them.\nKnowing this we can define two important words: Temperature is the average kinetic energy\nof particles in a system, or how much and how fast they move and entropy is the amount\nof disorder. Substances tend to be solid at low temperature\nand/or high pressure, which is a state of low entropy, as they‚Äôre neatly organized\nand don‚Äôt move that much, and gas at high temperature and/or low pressure, where they\nmove around like crazy, so it‚Äôs a state of high entropy.\nStrong bonds, like ionic bonds, lead to high melting points, as they take a lot of energy\nand therefore a high temperature to break apart. That‚Äôs why most salts are solid at\nroom temperature, whereas water, which is only being held together by hydrogen bonds,\nis a liquid. Well, actually (!), there‚Äôs another state\ncalled ‚Äúplasma‚Äù which is ionized gas and can exist at very high temperatures, such\nas in stars, or very high electric potential. The latter is used for neon lights. Gas is\nionized in a tube with a very high voltage. Collosions of the ions with other particles\nmakes their electrons move to a higher energy state. Once they falls back down, the difference\nin energy is released as light. The colour of the light depends on the element\nthat‚Äôs used in the tube, as each element has different, but fixed energy levels, and\nthe difference between those determines the energy and therefore the frequency of the\nreleased light, which is what changes the colour. All possible frequencies, that an\nelement can emit, are called the ‚Äúemission spectrum‚Äù.\nAll matter can be divided into two categories: Pure substances, which can consist of one\nelement or one compound, and mixtures. Mixtures consist of at least two pure substances¬† and can be homogeneous or¬†\nheterogeneous. Homogeneous means the substances will mix evenly and the\nmixture looks the same everywhere, like salt in water, which is a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù.\nHeterogeneous mixtures look different depending on where you look. They have distinct regions\nmade of separate substances. One example is sand in water, which is called a ‚Äúsuspension‚Äù.\nOkay, well what about milk? That looks the same everywhere, so it must be homogeneous!\nUhhh, no. Milk is something we call a ‚Äúcolloid‚Äù, or more precisely an ‚Äúemulsion‚Äù. The difference\nbetween salt water and milk is that the solute doesn‚Äôt fully dissolve in the solvent, meaning\nthere are bigger particles than in a solution, but smaller particles than in a suspension.¬† This allows the particles¬†\nto stay evenly distributed, but not fully dissolved, placing them somewhere\nbetween solutions and suspensions. ‚ÄÉ Hey remember sodium and water? What‚Äôs going\non here? Explosions are really just chemical reactions that release a lot of energy in\na very short amount of time. Also, they expand, like, a lot.\nThere‚Äôs a couple types of chemical reactions: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement,\nand double replacement. Here‚Äôs an example for each one.\nThey all happen mainly for one reason: To decrease energy and get to a more stable state.\nChemical reactions happen in certain ratios, for example, to produce water molecules, you\nneed twice the amount of hydrogen compared to oxygen. This is called ‚ÄúStoichiometry‚Äù.\nThese ratios are based on the conservation of mass, which says that mass cannot be created\nor destroyed, only converted. Practically, when dealing with reaction equations, you\nhave to make sure that there‚Äôs the same amount of atoms on each side of the equation,\nand if not, balance it out element by element. As a rule of thumb, you should balance out\nthe metals first, then the nonmetals, and hydrogen and oxygen at the end. But, it‚Äôs\nreally just trial and error until everything is balanced.\nOkay, but if we wanted to make this reaction happen in a lab, how would we know that we\nhave exactly twice the amount of hydrogen compared to oxygen? You can‚Äôt just take\n20 grams of this and mix it with 10 grams of that, because the atoms don‚Äôt weigh the\nsame, so 10 grams of both contain a different amount of particles.\nWhat to do? Just look up the atomic mass of the reactants\nand take that amount in grams. You‚Äôll get exactly this amount of particles. That is\n1 mole, which is just an amount of something, kind of like ‚Äúa dozen‚Äù. In other words,\nwe can interpret the reaction as 2 moles of this react with 1 mole of that, which we can\neasily measure. It‚Äôs important to differentiate between\nphysical and chemical changes, as reactions only take place in the latter. Physical change\nhappens when the appearance changes but the substance does not, for example hammering\nmetal. A chemical change happens when the substances themselves change and this is often\naccompanied by bubbles, a funky smell, or, you guessed it, explosions.\nAll chemical reactions need activation energy to take place. Wood won‚Äôt just spontaneously\nreact with oxygen and start burning, or else, you know, the planet would be on fire, but\nif you give it enough energy, it will. Catalysts reduce the activation energy needed for a\nreaction, which makes it happen easier and faster. And as a neat bonus, they don‚Äôt\neven get used up during the reaction, so you can just reuse them!\nBecause chemical reactions are changes in energy, it‚Äôs quite useful to keep track\nof it. ‚ÄúEnthalpy‚Äù is, simply put, the internal\nenergy or heat content of a system. If the total enthalpy of a reaction is lower at the\nend than at the beginning, heat was given off to the surroundings, which is an ‚Äúexothermic‚Äù\nreaction. If it‚Äôs the other way around a reaction is ‚Äúendothermic‚Äù.\nIt‚Äôs easy to see how exothermic reactions can be spontaneous. It‚Äôs kind of like a\nball on a hill. It will only start rolling if you push it a little bit, but then it will\nkeep rolling on its own, just like wood keeps burning on its own. But in endothermic reactions,\nyou have to keep putting in energy, like pushing a ball uphill. That doesn‚Äôt just spontaneously\nhappen, right? Well, yes, actually, it does. To get the whole picture, we have to look\nat Gibbs Free Energy, which looks at the change of enthalpy but also entropy of a system which\nis dependent on temperature. If this whole thing is less than zero, the\nreaction is ‚Äúexergonic‚Äù, or spontaneous, because free energy was released. If it‚Äôs\nbigger than zero, it‚Äôs ‚Äúendergonic‚Äù, or not spontaneous, because free energy was\nneeded and absorbed. Here‚Äôs where temperature and entropy come\ninto play: Even if delta H is positive, so the reaction is endothermic, if the change\nin entropy is big enough, it can offset this and make the total free energy negative, which\nmeans a reaction is spontaneous. But this is strongly dependent on the temperature.\nFor example, melting an ice cube is endothermic, because it absorbs heat, but also, it increases\nthe entropy a lot, as the neatly organized ice turns to water, which is just kind of\na mess. This can happen spontaneously, but only if the temperature is above 0. If it‚Äôs\nbelow 0, the water will spontaneously freeze, which is exothermic.\nIf it‚Äôs exactly 0, then no reaction will take place spontaneously. In other words,\nif delta G is 0, we‚Äôre at equilibrium. Chemical equilibriums exist when reversible\nreactions take place at the same speed in both directions, which means that even if\nreactions are taking place, the concentrations of both sides stay the same, and to someone\nwatching from the outside, nothing seems to be happening.\nWe often find chemical equilibriums in phase changes, but also acid base chemistry.\nAccording to Brondsted-Lowry, an acid is a molecule that donates protons, while bases\naccept protons. A proton in this case is just a hydrogen ion.\nSo, with this definition, a molecule with at least one hydrogen that it can throw away\ncan be an acid, and anything that can pick it up can be a base. This also means that\nonce they react, they turn into the conjugate opposite, as an acid that gave away a proton\ncan now accept one back, which is what bases do.\nA molecule that can act as both an acid and a base is called \"amphoteric\". A strong acid will dissociate almost completely\ninto its ionic form, giving off a lot of protons to the water and therefore creating lots of\nhydronium ions. A weak acid just won‚Äôt dissociate nearly as much, giving us a lower concentration\nof hydronium ions. So, to measure the strength of an acid we\ncan measure the concentration of Hydronium ions. This is called the ‚ÄúpH‚Äù.\nMathematically, it‚Äôs defined as the negative log of the hydronium concentration, which\nmeans one step on the scale is a 10x change, and also, since it‚Äôs a negative log, the\nhigher the concentration, the lower the pH. For example. Pure water is¬†\nin a chemical equilibrium.¬† There‚Äôs exactly one hydronium ion for every 10 million water molecules. In other words,\nthe concentration of hydronium is 1 over 10 million, or 1 times 10^-7. Taking the negative¬† log of this gives us a pH¬†\nof 7, which is considered neutral.\nAnything lower than 7 is acidic, and anything above is ‚Äúbasic‚Äù, unlike you.\nYou can do the same thing with hydroxide ions and you will get the pOH, which keep track\nof basicity. Fun Fact! The pH and pOH always add up to 14, because they counteract each\nother, so by knowing one, you know both! Now, if you have a strong base and a strong acid\nand you pour them together, no, they will not explode, they will neutralize by forming\nwater along with a salt, which is neutral. For example, Hydrochloride and Sodium Hydroxide\nwill form water and table salt. Oh yeah, speaking of table salt, remember\nhow it consists of ionic bonds, because sodium transfers an electron to chlorine? Well that\nis called a Reduction-Oxidation reaction or ‚Äúredox‚Äù.\nIf sodium chloride forms out of it‚Äôs pure elements, the sodium gets oxidized as it loses\nan electron, and the chlorine gets reduced, as it gains an electron. Logically, Sodium\nis the oxidant, and chlorine is the reductant. Of course not, that would make sense, it‚Äôs\nother way around. More accurately, redox reactions are reactions\nthat change the oxidation numbers of elements, which are kind of like imaginary charges.\nThere‚Äôs just a few rules you have to know to figure those out:\nHydrogen is mostly +1, Oxygen is mostly -2, halogens are mostly -1, single elements are\nalways 0, and the numbers of all atoms in a molecule always have to add up to the molecule‚Äôs\ncharge. So this would total 0, while single ions just have their charge as the oxidation\nnumber. For example, in sulfuric acid, we have 4 oxygens, which totals -8, we have two\nhydrogens, which brings the total to -6, and since the whole molecule is neutral, sulfur\nmust have an oxidation number of +6. Just by looking at the oxidation numbers of\nreactants and products you can deduce the flow of electrons, which¬†\ngives you these equations.¬† If redox reactions happen in acidic or basic solutions, you can balance out the charges\nwith the ions, and fix the stoichiometry with water.\n‚ÄÉ Okay, now to this weird looking thing. I spared\nyou from it because for describing electrons, this is very simple, and this not. But, this\nis actually like, pretty wrong, electrons don‚Äôt orbit in circles. Here‚Äôs how it\nactually works: All electrons inside an atom are described\nby four quantum numbers. N, l, ml, and ms. N corresponds to the shells, so all electrons\nwith the same n are in the same shell. Within the shells we have subshells, with\nmultiple orbitals, which are three dimensional regions in space where electrons could be.\nWe know these exist thanks to schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equation, which gives a probabilistic wave\nfunction. You can imagine it as cloud, and the denser it is, the more likely an electron\nis to be there if we were to look for it. L describes the shape and ml the orientation\nof orbitals in a subshell. There are four subshells called s, p, d and\nf. If electrons have the same l, they‚Äôre in the same subshell. If electrons have the\nsame n, l, and ml, they are in the same orbital. Also, the number of orbitals increases by\ntwo for every bigger subshell, starting at just one for s.\nThe last quantum number describes an intrinsic property of electrons called ‚Äúspin‚Äù, which\ncan have two values. Some guy named Pauli said two electrons can\nnever have the exact same quantum numbers inside one atom. Since ms can only have two\nvalues, every orbital defined by n l and ml, can hold a maximum of 2 electrons with opposite\nspin. Therefore the s subshell can hold 2 electrons,\nthe p subshell can hold 6, d can hold 10, and f can hold 14.\nNow, the quantum numbers restrain each other like this, which means that the first shell\ncan only have an s subshell, the second can have an s and a p subshell, and so on.\nThis means that the first shell can hold a total of 2 electrons, the second can hold\n8, the third can hold 18, and generally, the number of electrons a shell can hold follows\nthe rule 2n2, with n being the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number, and\ntherefore total number of shells increases from top to bottom in the periodic table,\nfrom 1 to 7. Every element has a different number of electrons\nthat fill up these orbitals, and the different subshells and orbitals are filled in a specific\norder, called the ‚ÄúAufbauprinciple‚Äù: just write down the subshells like this and draw\ndiagonal lines from top right to bottom left. To get an electron configuration, just look\nup the number of electrons of the element in the periodic table, and fill up the subshells\nin this order, until there are no electrons left. This would be the electron configuration\nof Sodium. You can also look up the next smallest noble\ngas and shorten it by just referring to its electron configuration as the base, because\nthose shells are full, and don‚Äôt change for any bigger elements. This is also how\nyou can figure out the valence electrons for transition metals. Just look up their electron\nconfiguration, ignore the full shells of the next smallest noble gas, and the remaining\nelectrons are the valence electrons! Easy peasy.\nAnyways! All this knowledge going to cost you one subscribe and a thumbs up, thank you\nvery much, your comment is my delight, and I shall now guide you, fine person, to the\nexit, where the next lesson is excitedly waiting for you."

        "transcription": "in this video we're going to focus on chemistry we're going to go over some of the basic topics that you need to know if you're about to take a course in chemistry so let's begin let's start with the periodic table so you need to know the names of the elements the groups and some of their properties so in the First Column you have H which represents hydrogen and then lithium sodium pottassium rubidium now hydrogen is a nonmetal but the other ones below that lithium sodium potassium rubidium and even cesium those are known as alkaline metals the alkaline metals are the most reactive of the metals in a periodic table if you let's say put sodium and water it will react violently now the elements in this row they all have one valence electron therefore they like to form ions with plus one charges now in the next column we have elements such as burum magnesium calcium strontium barium these are known as the alkaline earth metals these metals are reactive as well but they don't react as violently as the alkali metals Now The Alkali earth metals they have two valence electrons the valence electrons are those electrons that are in the outermost energy level of an atom the inner electrons are known as the core electrons The Alkali earth metals they like to form ions with a plus two charge metals they like to give away electrons as they release electrons they will form a positively charged ion known as a cation the vertical columns are known as groups in the periodic table so the alkali metals is Group 1 a The Alkali earth metals is group 2A the rows are the period this is period one period 2 period 3 and so forth and next to potassium and calcium you have the transition metals you have have a scandium titanium vadium chromium manganese iron Cobalt nickel copper and zinc below copper you have silver and gold below zinc you have a cadmium and Mercury Mercury is HG next to Sil silver you have padium and platinum these are some common elements that you want to know the name of now the transition metals they have variable charges at least most of them do for example iron can be in the plus2 OR plus three oxidation state copper is typically + one or plus2 so they have variable charges but some of the transition metals like zinc have a a common charge of plus two 99% of the time zinc has a charge of plus two same is true for cadmium silver is usually + one gold could be plus one or plus three Mercury could be+ one or plus2 so you need to know the charges of some of these ions Cobalt is usually between plus2 and plus three meanes could vary from plus2 to plus 7 chromium typically as a a monoatomic ion plus 2 and plus three so those are the transition medals so let's say this is the transition metal area over here you have group one and group two then in this region you have the inner transition metals the top part is known as the lanthanides and the group below that represents the aines and then you have the elements on this side which we're about to go over so groups 1 to 2 a and groups 13 to 18 these are known as representative elements group 3 to 12 is the transition medals and then this is the inner transition metals which are nonrepresentative elements now let's focus on groups 13 to 18 Group 13 is also known as group 3A and the elements in this group are Boron aluminum gallium indium andium next to Boron you have carbon and below that silicon germanium tin and lead this is group 4 a the group 3A elements they have three valence electrons and most of them like to form plus three charges for example aluminum likes to form a plus three charge ion same is true for gum but gum I've seen the plus one and plus three state for indium it can be+ one or plus three and the same is true for theum but aluminum usually doesn't form the plus1 ion it's for the most part plus three now for the group four elements silicon for example can have a plus two or plus4 oxidation state these elements have four valence electrons germanium tin and lead you'll see that they can also have a plus two charge or a plus4 charge next we have nitrogen phosphorus selenium I mean not selenium I take that back below phosphorus is arsenic s SP is antimony and bi is bismuth so make sure you know the names of the elements because typically that's your first quiz in a regular chemistry course so this is group 5A these elements they have five veence electrons however they like to form a negative three charges these are the nonmetals at least most of them are nitrogen likes to form a minus three charge and the same is true for phosphide or phosphorus as an element it's called phosphorus but when it has a neg3 charge it's called phosphide n as an element is called nitrogen but as an ion with a neg3 charge is called nitride with the ID ending the next group group 6A or group 16 these elements they have six veence electrons and they like to form ions with a negative2 charge negatively charged ions are known as anions so we have oxygen sulfur selenium tonium and polonium these are known as the calogen next to that you have the group 7A element or group 17 and you have Florine chlorine bromine iodine or iodine and atine so these have seven veence electrons and they like to form negative one charges so as ions it's fluoride chloride bromide and iodide o with a negative charge or negative2 charge is oxide sulfide selenide and so forth the halogens are the most reactive nonmetals as we said before metals they like to give away electrons so metals are they form good reducing agents non-metals like to accept or acquire electrons so non-metals are usually good oxidizing agents nonmetals like Helens are very very reactive Florine is the most reactive non-metal francium is one of the most reactive metals which is on the other side of the periodic table below cesium the alkaline metal you have francium because Florine really wants to have electrons it is Electro negative electr negativity increases towards floring so as you go up and as you go to the right electro negativity increases so what this means is that Florine has a very strong desire for electrons florine's desire for electrons is greater than that of oxygen and chlorine so nonmetals tend to be Electro negative metals are usually electropositive Electro negative elements once they acquire the electrons that they want they form negative charges electropositive elements like metals they like to give away electrons and they're going to develop a positive charge now Group AA or group 18 this represents the noble gases so over here you have helium helium has two valence electrons it doesn't have eight the first row elements they can only have a maximum of two electrons in their first energy level elements in the second row can have up to eight electrons in their energy levels or in their second energy level neon has eight valence electrons and then below neon you have elements such as Argon Krypton Xenon and radon the noble gases are chemically inert they're very stable They Don't Really participate much in chemical reactions so if you get a test question and it ask you which element is non-reactive carbon nitrogen Florine or neon your answer is neon now let's see if you get a question that asks you which of the following elements is is or shares the same chemical reactivity or is most similar chemically speaking let's say we have nitrogen oxygen sulfur Florine and neon whenever you have two elements in the same column they share similar chemical properties so in this case oxygen and sulfur are chemically similar because they're both calcin they're in the same column so Florine and chlorine are chemically similar to each other they're both Helens they have the same number of veence electrons and so their chemical reactivity is similar now you need to know where the metals and the non-metals are with respect to the periodic table so if you look at a typical periodic table you're going to see like a line which goes like this to the lower left of that line you have metals on the upper right side you have nonmetals so elements Like Oxygen Florine sulfur chlorine these are all non-metals but elements like indium gallium lead aluminum those are metals and then in between you have metalloids the most two common metalloids that you'll see in chemistry are silicon and geranium those are the most common metalloids that you'll be tested on Metals conduct electricity metals can also conduct heat as well metals are IM malleable they could be hammered into sheets and they're ductile they can be drawn into wires nonmetals do not conduct electricity metalloids they conduct a small amount of electricity nonmetals are insulators metals are conductors metalloids they're conductors but with a very high resistance or electrical resistance so metalloids they conduct only a very very small amount of electricity now which metaloid do you think conducts more electricity silicon or geranium as you travel to the left and down across the periodic table the elements become more metallic metallic character increases this way so which one behaves more like a metal silicon or geranium so carbon for the most part is considered to be a nonmetal silicon and geranium or metalloids tin think of a tin can tin metal well tin is a metal lead is metal so as you go down across the periodic table the elements are becoming more metallic which means that the electrical conductivity is increasing so lead can conduct electricity better than Tin Tin metal can conduct electricity better than geranium so geranium even though it's a metaloid can conduct electricity better than silicon because geranium has more metallic character than silicon now now carbon has different forms known as allotropes carbon has carbon can be in a form of diamond which does not conduct electricity at all but diamond is an excellent conductor of heat or carbon could be in graphite which you can find it in penciled carbon graphite does conduct electricity so make sure you're aware of that so the metalloids are silicon geranium arsenic antimony te ban for the most part is considered to be a metaloid but the most common are silicon and geranium and now the next thing that we need to go over are the diatomic elements hydrogen in its natural state doesn't exist as H hydrogen exists as H2 it's diatomic so it exists as a molecule and nitrogen is datomic then you have oxygen Florine chlorine bromine and iodine these are all diatomic and this is something you just have to know hydrogen is a gas at room temperature nitrogen is a gas oxygen is a gas Florine is a gas chlorine is like a a greenish gas bromine is a red liquid and iodine is a purple volatile solid iodine under normal standard temperature and pressure conditions even though it's a solid it can Sublime directly into a gas whenever a substance go from a solid to a gas it's known as sublimation so make sure you know your seven diatomic elements now the next thing that we need to go over are bonds Cove valent bonds and ionic bonds so what exactly is an ionic bond and what is the difference between a calent bond and ionic bonds consider the reaction between sodium metal and chlorine so let's say if we have an atom of chlorine as opposed to a diatomic molecule sodium has one valence electron and chlorine has seven veence electrons now as we mentioned before metals they like to give away their electrons nonmetals like to acquire electrons so sodium is going to give away its one electron to chlorine when sodium loses that electron it becomes a positively charged cation chlorine on the other hand now it has eight valence electrons and so it becomes a negatively charged anion whenever you have two like charges next to each other these two will feel a force that repels them opposite charges will like charges repel but opposite charge is attract now sodium it has a positive charge chlorine has a negative charge so these two ions they feel a force of attraction that keeps them together it is that electr static force of attraction that holds the ionic bonds together so remember ionic bonds are associated with a transfer of electrons they're composed of ions that are attracted to each other and also typically not always but generally speaking you can identify them because they contain a metal and a non-metal whenever you mix a metal and a non-metal together they react in such a way to form ionic bonds now in a calent bond the electrons are shared for example let's say if we have two hydrogen atoms each with one veence electron these hydrogen atoms will react in such a way to create a bond and in this Bond there are two electrons those two electrons are shared between the two hydrogen atoms and so this is a calent bond since we have sharing of electrons now because the elements are identical because they have the same electro negativity this is classified as a non-polar calent Bond because the electrons are distributed equally it's non-polar now let's say if we have two dissimilar elements for example hydrogen and Florine now these are both nonmetals two nonmetals typically form a calent bond now hydrogen is going to donate one electron to form the bond and Florine is going to donate one so HF looks like this now Florine is significantly much more electronegative than hydrogen so Florine is going to pull the electrons toward itself so because the electrons are shared unequally the bond is going to be considered a polar coent bond as Florine pulls the electrons toward itself it's going to acquire a partial negative charge and hydrogen since it loses some of those electrons it's it's going to acquire a partial positive charge whenever you have a neutral molecule but where one side is partially positive and the other is partially negative you have a polarized substance you have a dipole to draw the dipole the arrow has to point towards the more Electro negative atom the electr negativity of Florine if you look it up in the table most textbooks would say 4.0 and for hydrogen 2.1 whenever the electro negativity difference if it's greater than than .5 or if it's equal to or greater than5 the bond is considered to be polar if it's less than 0.5 it's usually non-polar so whenever you have separation of charge within a molecule you have a polarized molecule now consider this bond between carbon and nitrogen do you think this bond is polar or non-polar carbon has an electr negativity value of 2.5 and for hydrogen it's 2.1 now both of these elements are non-metals so we have a CO valent Bond we just need to decide if it's polar or non-polar the difference is 2.5 minus 2.1 so it's about 04 therefore this bond is considered to be relatively non-polar since the difference is not 0 five or more so anytime you have a molecule that contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms automatically you know it's a non-polar molecule now it's time to take a mini quiz let's see if you remember what you've learned so far classify the following compounds as ionic or coent feel free to pause the video as you work out these examples so MGO magnesium oxide is it ionic or calent magnesium is a metal it's found on the left side of the periodic table oxygen is a nonmetal whenever you have a metal and a nonmetal combined this is going to be ionic CO2 carbon dioxide carbon is a nonmetal oxygen is a nonmetal when you have two non-metals you have a coent molecule if it's coent typically it's usually molecular so you can also classify as a molecular compound it's composed of molecules now what about water hydrogen is a nonmetal oxygen is a non-metal so this is classified as coent for lithium chloride lithium is on the left side of the periodic table and that's a metal chlorine is a nonmetal be careful cuz hydrogen is on the left side but hydrogen is not classified as a metal hydrogen and lithium are in the same column but lithium is a metal hydrogen is a nonmetal so this is ionic Florine is composed only of non-metals so this is coent now because Florine it's made up of the same element the bond between those two elements is a non-polar calent Bond because thean difference is zero now the bond between carbon and oxygen that's a polar equalent bond because thean difference is much greater than 05 and between oxygen and hydrogen that's also a polar coent bond now you need to be careful with the exceptions for example example let's say if you have magnesium sulfate what type of bonds are found in this compound magnesium has a plus two charge sulfate is a polyatomic ion with a negative two charge so because we have ions we Justus have an ionic bond the ionic bond is between the magnesium ion and the sulfate ion as you can see magnesium is a metal and sulfur and oxygen are composed of non-metals now within the sulfate ion you have coent bonds the bond between oxygen and sulfur is coent sulfur is a nonmetal oxygen is a nonmetal both of these elements are found in the upper right corner of the periodic table so that's a calent bond between the oxygen and the sulfur so if you have a compound that contains a metal and a non-metal and that also has a polyatomic ion poly means many a polyatomic ion is an ion with many atoms so if you have a metal with a polyatomic ion it has ionic and coent bonds now there are some ionic bonds that don't have Metals a good example is the ammonium ion if you see nh4 of something like ammonium chloride this is ionic the nh4+ ion is a polyatomic ion and chlorine has a negative charge so here we have ions with charges so this is an ionic bond but within the ammonium ion the bonds between hydrogen and nitrogen both of them are non-metals so this is a coent bond so ammonium chloride has ionic and calent bonds but there's no Metals so most compounds that are composed of metals and non-metals are ionic but there are some that you have to watch out for that do not contain Metals now the next thing that we need to talk about is atomic structure the structure of the atom but let's go over some things on a periodic table so C represents carbon and if you look at the symbol for carbon there's two numbers one one above it and one below it the smaller of the two numbers is the atomic number the atomic number is equal to the number of protons now for a neutral atom the number of electrons and protons are the same for ions ions are particles with unequal number of electrons and that's why they have a net charge the bottom number is the average atomic mass of all of the isotopes of carbon now don't confuse isotopes with allotropes I'll explain what Isotopes are so this number let's say if we have the carbon 12 isotope this is the mass number the mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons so an element of carbon has six protons so the nucleus which contains the protons and the neutrons the nucleus has a net charge of plus 6 protons are positively charged electrons are negatively charged and neutrons are neutral now a neutral atom of carbon has six electrons in the first energy level there are two electrons in that energy level the first level can only hold a maximum of two the second level can have up to eight so the second level contains means the four electrons that are remaining so carbon has a total of six electrons notice that carbon is in group 4 a of the periodic table therefore it has four valence electrons the four valence electrons are the electrons in the outermost energy level of carbon the two electrons on the inside are known as core electrons here's a question for you in the nucleus of a helium atom helium has a mass of four and atomic number of two in this form it looks like the atomic number and the mass number are switched but the lower of the two numbers is the atomic number helium has two protons two neutrons so in the nucleus the protons carry a plus charge the neutrons are neutral and and helium only has two electrons which are valence electrons because it only has one energy level now we know that opposite charges attract so the electrons and the protons they're attracted to each other so the electrons feel a force that keeps it rotating in a circle whenever you have a force that directs a particle towards the center of the circle it's called a cental force and it keeps it rotating in a circle so even though the particle may be moving to the right the electron is going to stay in a circle because of the cbal force which is caused by the electrostatic force between electrons and the protons a cental force always keeps an object in a circle if you think of the Moon why it orbits the earth the gravitational force that pulls the moon towards the Earth keeps the moon in orbit around the Earth and that gravitational force is acting as a centri force I know we kind of jump into physics here but it's a good time to talk about it now if opposite charges attract each other then life charges must repel each other so how is it that the nucleus remains intact when you have these two protons that are so close next to each other shouldn't they fly apart due to the electrostatic force that wants to push them away from each other it's turns out that there's a strong nuclear force that keeps the protons together and that must be a very very strong force if you split the atom a lot of energy will be released which is a nuclear reaction but the strong nuclear force keeps the protons together inside the nucleus now let's go over some examples let's say if we we have an element of Florine Florine has an atomic mass of 19 and an atomic number of nine how many protons neutrons and electrons are in this Florine atom so let's write some equations to find the number of protons it's simply equal to the atomic number the number of neutrons is the mass number minus the atomic number and the number of electrons is the atomic number minus the charge if there was a charge it would be right here but if there's no charge we have a neutral atom which means the protons and electrons are equal so the atomic number is nine which means that Florine has nine protons the mass number is 19 but the difference gives you the number of neutrons 19 - 9 is 10 so Florine has 10 neutrons the number of electrons is the atomic number minus the charge since the atom is neutral it doesn't have a charge so it's 9us Z therefore there are nine electrons in this atom now out of the nine electrons how many electrons are valence electrons Florine has seven veence electrons you can find this number based on the group that Florine is located in Florine is located in group 7A which is the same as Group 17 and so it has seven veence electrons so how many core electrons does it have the total must be nine so 9 - 7 is 2 so Florine has two core electrons but seven veence electrons for a total of nine electrons consider arsenic which has an atomic number of 33 and a mass number of 75 how many protons neutrons electrons core electrons and valence electrons are found in an atom of arsenic so because the atomic number is 33 arsenic has 33 protons the number of the neutrons is the difference between 75 and 33 75 - 33 is 42 so arsenic has 42 neutrons now because we have an atom of arsenic which is neutral it doesn't have any charge the number of protons and electrons are the same now how many veence electrons does Arsenic have so arsenic is found in group 5A of the periodic table so therefore arsenic has five valence electrons so how many core electrons does it have so 33 - 5 is 28 therefore arenic has 28 core electrons so the core electrons plus the veence electrons must add to the total number of electrons now let's try another example aluminum has an atomic number of 13 and a mass number of 27 and we're going to focus on the aluminum plus three cation how many protons electrons and neutrons are found in this particular ion so the atomic number is 13 therefore it contains 13 protons the difference between the mass number and the atomic number 27 - 13 is 14 so it has 14 neutrons now the number of electrons in this ion is the atomic number minus the charge so 13 - 3 is 10 so it has 10 electrons if you add up the the charges we have a charge of 13 from the 13 protons and a charge of -10 from the 10 electrons 13 - 10 is + three which is the net charge of the ion now what if we have a negatively charged ion let's say if we have the phosphide ion which has an atomic number of 15 and a mass number of 31 how many protons electrons and neutrons are in this ion so because the atomic number is 15 it has 15 protons the atomic number or the number of protons identifies the element now 31 - 15 is 16 so it has 16 neutrons to calculate the electrons is the atomic number minus the charge 15-3 is the same as 15 + 3 which is 18 electrons so if you add up the charges we have a net charge of posi 15 from the 15 protons and a net charge of8 from the 18 electrons so the overall charge 15 +8 is -3 so whenever an ion has more electrons than protons it has a net negative charge if it has more protons than electrons then the over all charge is positive now let's go over the different types of isotopes of carbon the most two common isotopes of carbon is carbon 12 and carbon 13 chemically speaking these atoms of carbon behave the same way they're both Elemental carbons Isotopes they have the same same chemical reactivity but their nuclear properties are different because the nucleus is different but the number of electrons is the same and the number of protons the same now how many protons are found in each of these two isotopes of carbon both contain six protons to find the number of neutrons is the mass number minus the atomic number so the one on the left contains six neutrons the one on the right has seven neutrons 13 - 6 is seven but because these are both atoms of carbon that means that they're electrically neutral the number of electrons are the same so you need to know how Isotopes differ from one another Isotopes they have the same atomic number the same number of protons and they're made up of the same element in this case Elemental carbon so that's how they're similar but how are they different isotopes they differ in their mass number and they differ in the number of neutrons so therefore they're different in their nucleus so they have different nuclear properties carbon 12 is stable but carbon 13 decays over time now if you look at the periodic table at Elemental carbon you'll see that the mass number is not exactly 12 it's like 12. 0 1 and as we mentioned before this is the average atomic mass of all of the carbon Isotopes you also have carbon 14 but that's very very rare approximately 99% of carbon atoms is the carbon 12 isotope and about 1% is carbon 13 so let's say if you have a sample of 100 carbon atoms 99 of those carbon atoms will be carbon 12 and one would be carbon 13 if you have a th000 carbon atoms 990 would be carbon 12 10 would be carbon3 since 1% of a th000 is 10 you can calculate the average atomic mass by using a weighted average the average atomic mass is equal to the mass of the io times its relative percent abundance plus the mass of the other I tote times its percentage now if you have a third isotope it's going to be plus M3 P3 and if there's more this can keep going on forever but we can calculate the average based on those two isotopes the mass of the first carbon atom carbon 12 is 12 the percentage is 99% 99% as a decimal is 99 to convert percent to a decimal divide it by 100 or simply move the decimal point two units to the left now carbon 13 has a mass of 13 but a percentage of 01 so if you multiply 12 by .99 you're going to get 11.88 if you multiply 13 by 01 it's going to be3 and if you add3 plus 11.88 you should get 12.01 which is the average or the weighted average atomic mass of all of the carbon isotopes that are naturally found on Earth now what about boron boron has an average atomic mass of 10.81 and it's element five on the periodic table now boron has two principal Isotopes Boron t 10 and Boron 11 notice that the average is between 10 and 11 so if you have the two isotopes and the average atomic mass how can you use that information to find the relative percent abundance of these two isotopes so in nature or on Earth what percentage of born atoms is the B10 isope and what percentage is the b11 io so we're going to start with the same equation so the average is equal to M1 P1 plus M2 P2 so the average is 10.81 the mass of the first isotope is 10 and the percentage we're going to call it X now it's important to understand something let's say if the B10 ice toope is 70% that means that 30% is Bor on 11 so if x corresponds to 70 then 30 must be 1 - x because 1 -30 I mean 1 - 70 is30 so notice that x + 1 - x adds up to 1 and one represents 100% M2 is the mass of the second iope which is 11 and as you mentioned the percentage is going to be 1 - x so we need to solve for the value of x so it's going to be 10 x and if we distribute the 11 11 * 1 is 11 and 11 * X that's -1x so now we need to add like terms so the two like terms are 10 x and 11x 10 - 11 is1 or simplyx and now at this point we need to subtract both sides by 11 and now let's make some space 10.81 - 11 is119 those two numbers cancel so19 is X if you multiply both sides by1 X is9 which corresponds to 19% now X was associated with the B10 ice ta so we have 19% of boron 10 100 - 19 is 81% so that is the relative percent abundance of the other iceo b11 so notice that we have more of the b11 iob than Boron 10 and it makes sense because the average is closer to 11 than it is to 10 10.81 is close to 11 so we have more of the Bor 11 ice to so this is how you can calculate the relative percent abundance of an ice taup um within an element what we're going to do now now is have a pop quiz on the properties of the elements in the periodic table so consider the following elements iron metal magnesium bromine aluminum and lithium so which of the following is a transition metal what do you think the answer is Fe is a transition metal it's between groups 3 and 12 now which are the following elements is the most reactive metal listed here the most reactive metal is typically an alkaline metal and lithium is the only alkaline metal in this group lithium is found in the First Column of the periodic table now which one is a nonmetal which element is found in the upper right corner of the prct table this is bromine bromine is a nonmetal now which of the following elements is an alkaline earth metal magnesium is an alkaline earth metal it has two valence electrons and it's in the second column of the periodic table now which of the following elements has three veence electrons is it Fe mg G bromine aluminum or lithium it turns out aluminum which is found in group 3A or group 13 has three valance electrons consider these elements zinc bromine silicon iodine and Florine now these are datomic which of the following elements is a liquid at room temperature is it zinc bromine silicon iodine or Florine bromine is a red liquid now which of the following elements has the greatest electrical conductivity it turns out zinc has the greatest electrical connectivity because it's the only metal that's listed here now which of the following elements is a metaloid silicon is a metaloid it's used to make solar cells which convert light energy into electricity now which of the following is a solid at room temperature iodine is a purple solid and which one is a gas Florine is a gas at room temperature consider these elements as well argon uranium chromium iron metal and sulfur well let's write sulfur as S8 so which of the following elements is attracted to a magnet which element can be magnetized it turns out iron metal is ferromagnetic that's the symbol Fe iron metal if you put it next to a a magnet it's going to stick to the magnet now which element in its ionic form forms colored Solutions particularly different colors most transition metals will form Color Solutions but the most common one is chromium chromium has multiple oxidation States and it forms a variety of colors now iron metal is a transition metal so it to can form a variety of colors but chromium takes its one another level chromium has a lot more colors than Fe now which of these elements is an inner transition metal uranium is an inner transition metal it's part of the actinide series now which of these elements is chemically inert it doesn't really participate in chemical reactions the answer is argon argon is a noble gas and the noble gases are chemically stable they don't like to participate in chemical reactions they have no need of gaining or losing electrons which element is a yellow solid at room temperature but when melted it turns into a blood red liquid and when burned in the presence of oxygen it produces a blue flame which element is that this element is sulfur now consider these other elements Mercury gold chlorine carbon and Germania which of the following elements is a liquid at room temperature Mercury is liquid at room temperature it's called Quicks silver and it conducts electricity as any metal now which of the following elements is known as a noble metal gold is a noble metal it's very difficult to oxidize it's chemically stabilized gold for the most part most of the precious elements or the precious metals like padium Silver Platinum these elements are known as Noble Metals they're very stable chemically speaking they're very resist resistant to corrosion and they're very expensive too those Noble Metals now which of the following elements does not conduct electricity is it Mercury gold chlorine carbon or geranium the only one that doesn't conduct electricity is the non-metal chlorine which is diatomic as cl2 all of the other elements can conduct electricity Mercury is a metal so it can conduct electricity and gold is a metal too so gold can conduct electricity as well germanium is a metaloid and so it can conduct a small amount of electricity carbon is a non metal but it has different forms different allotropes the diamond form of carbon does not conduct electricity however the graphite form of carbon does conduct electricity so the only answer the only element that does not conduct electricity is Elemental chlorine now which of the following elements is a gas at room temperature this would also be chlorine chlorine is a gas at room temperature so make sure you know some common properties of the elements in the periodic table you might see them on your next exam here's a question for you helium is it composed of atoms molecules or compounds what is the difference between an atom and a molecule helium like all the other noble gases are composed of atoms so helium looks like a single particle it's made up of a single atom hydrogen gas is a molecule a molecule is made up of two or more atoms it's a individual particle that has multiple atoms water for example is a molecule and a compound at the same time so water contains an atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen so it looks like that so helium is composed of atoms hydrogen it's made up of molecules a molecule is composed of two or more atoms it could be the same type of atom or different atoms water is also classified as a molecule because it contains more than two atoms but also water is known as a compound a compound is a substance that contains two or more different types of atoms or two or more different elements water is a compound because it contains hydrogen and oxygen H2 is not a compound because it contains only one type of element so H2 is classified as a Pure Element it consists only of Elemental hydrogen water is not a Pure Element it's made up of two different types of elements helium is a Pure Element it's only made up of helium atoms now what about sodium chloride how would you classify ify it and let's compare it to water sodium chloride is a compound because it has two different elements but this is not a molecular compound this is known as an ionic compound because sodium chloride is composed of ions whenever you see a metal and a non-metal it's usually ionic water is a compound as well but it's also a molecule so it's a molecular compound so water is composed of individual particles whereas sodium chloride it's a giant crystal that contains many ions you have sodium ions chloride ions and you have billions of these ions together in a ID so you have a huge network of ions bonded together but in water you have individual particles which makes it a molecule so here's a quiz view I'm going to give you a list of substances and I want you to identify them as being a molecule a Pure Element being composed of atoms ionic compound or molecular compound so we have CO2 argon magnesium sulfide zinc metal and F2 so let's start with CO2 how would you classify them so this substance is composed of two nonmetals so this is going to be a molecule since it's composed of many atoms but it's also a compound because it's composed of different elements so it's a molecular compound now what about argon argon is a noble gas so it's made up of atoms and it's also a Pure Element we only have one type of element in this substance magnesium sulfide this is composed of a metal and a non-metal so it's ionic and it's a compound so it's a ionic compound anytime you of a compound it's never going to be a Pure Element zinc is composed of atoms but these atoms are coal bonded to each other and zinc is a Pure Element we only have one type of element in a substance Florine is a Pure Element but it's also a molecule because it's composed of it's a individual particle that is composed of two atoms so now you know how to classify substances now what is the difference between a pure substance and a mixture a mixture is the combination of two or more pure substances for example if you mix water which is a pure substance with sodium chloride you have a mixture a salt water mixture if you mix hydrogen with helium you now have a mixture so mixture is simply the combination of two or more pure substances sodium chloride is a pure substance even though it's a a compound that has two different elements it's still classified as a pure substance a mixture can be separated into its components by physical means so for example you can separate water from Salt Water by evaporation that's a physical process but you can't separate sodium from chlorine in Salt by evaporation or by by boiling or by some physical process at least not under practical conditions so therefore sodium chloride is not a mixture you can't separate sodium from chlorine using common physical processes you have to use a chemical process to separate the atoms within a compound so remember mixture is simply the combination of two or more pure substances so individually H2 is a pure substance helium is a pure substance but combined it's a mixture so whenever you see this plus it's going to be a mixture now there's two types of mixtures that you need to be familiar with homogeneous mixtures and heterogeneous mixtures consider the two mixtures let's say if we have a saltwater solution where we have free flowing sodium and chloride ions in water and on the right side we have an oil water mixture now we know that water and oil don't mix typically oil is less dense than water and so it floats on top which one is homogeneous and which one is heterogeneous The Saltwater mixture is the homogeneous mixture because the salt water is distributed uh uniformly throughout the solution and so it's homogeneous if you look at it you'll see one clear distinct Solution on the right side we have a heterogeneous solution you can clearly see two distinct phases you can see the oil and the water um separately from each other because they don't mix very well they don't mix evenly or at all it's heterogeneous so let's say if you have water and you have sand in the water is it homogeneous or heterogeneous so notice that the sand is not evenly distributed throughout the water you can clearly see two distinct phases you can literally see the sand and the water separate from each other this is a heterogeneous mixture now what about air is air a homogeneous mixture or a heterogeneous mixture air is a mixture of gases air contains mostly nitrogen and oxygen gas about 78% of it is nitrogen and 21% is oxygen the remainder are gases like argon CO2 water vapor and some other stuff but these gases are evenly distributed throughout air they're evenly they're mix with each other um in a in an even ratio so to speak so for example let's say if you have a room the composition of air in this region is 78% nitrogen 21% oxygen and in this region it's not going to be 50% nitrogen and 50% oxygen it's always going to be 78% oxygen I mean nitrogen and 21% oxygen the distribution of these molecules is even throughout this particular room so therefore air is a homogeneous mixture now let's move on to another topic that is unit conversion you need to know that 1 mile is equal to 5,280 ft one mile is also 1.609 kilometers feel free to take notes in one kilometer there are 1,000 m 1 meter is about 100 cm and 1 inch is 2.54 CM there's three feet in a yard and 12 in in a foot 1 millit is equal to 1 cubic cener and 1,000 milliters is equivalent to 1 liter so these are units for distance for time you know that one year is 365 days one month is approximately 30 days a day is 24 hours an hour is 60 minutes and a minute is 60 seconds so these are some common conversions that you want to know so let's say if you have 460 M how can you convert that to kilomet now the first thing that you want to do is identify the conversion factor that you need the conversion factor between kilometers and meters is this 1 kilometer is 1,000 m now start with what you're given we're going to write 460 M over 1 in the next fraction you need to place the conversion factor but in the appropriate order to notice that we have meters on the top left that means we need to put the unit meters on the bottom right the number that's associated with meters or that's next to it is a th000 so that a th000 is going to be right next to the meters so on top we're going to put 1 kilm so the unit meters cancel and we're going to get km so because the th is on the bottom we need to divide instead of multiply so it's 460 ID th000 whenever you divide by th000 simply move the decimal three units to the left so 460 m is equivalent to 460 kilm let's try another example convert 75 millimeters into cenm the conversion factor is 10 mm is equal to a CM so how would you set it up and what's the answer so let's start with what we have which is 75 mm now since we have millimeters on the top left we need to put it in the bottom right and the 10 is associated with with millimet so let's put that there and 1 cm is going to go on top so these units cancel and it's 75 / 10 which if you move the decimal one unit to the left it's going to be 7.5 cm now let's say if we have a multi-step problem for example if you have 25 kilm how can you convert that into feet so we know that 1 mile is equal to 5,280 ft and 1 mile is 1.609 KM so we need to convert from kilometers to miles and then miles to feet so how can we do it feel free to pause the video and try this example yourself so let's start with what we're given now in the next fraction we need to put the kilometers on the bottom so that these units will cancel and we want to convert it to meters initially so we know that 1.609 km this is supposed to be Miles by the way not meters 1.609 km is 1 mile so now we can convert miles into feet so we got to put the unit miles in the bottom one mile is equal to 5,2 80 ft and so the unit miles cancel and this is going to give us the answer in feet so it's. 25 divided by 1.609 * 5280 and you should get 82.4 ft now let's say if you have a unit of area for example 36 square feet how can you convert it into square yards what can we do so we know the conversion factor there's 3et in a yard so always start with what you're given now in the next fraction we need to put feet on the bottom yards on top so we know there three feet in one yard but because we have a square here we need to square it so we need to divide 36 by 3 2 times or by 9 3 S is 9 so the unit feet squar will cancel and we're going to get yard squared so 36 / 3 is 12 and 36 I mean 12 divid 3 a second time is four so it's four square yards this is the same as 36 ID 9 which is four now let's try another example let's say if we wish to convert 5,000 cubic millimet into cubic cm how can we do it so this is a unit of volume whenever it's raised to the third dimension we know the conversion factor is 10 10 mm is equivalent to 1 cm so we're going to put that in the next fraction now for this particular example we need to raise it to the third power so we need to divide 5,000 by 10 three times or by 10 Cub which is a th000 5,000 ID 10 is 500 500 ID 10 is 50 50 ID 10 is 5 so this is 5 Cub cm or you could say 5,000 / 1,000 is 5 so now you know how to convert from one unit of volume to another unit of volume how would you convert 30 m/ second into miles per hour which can also be written as mph how can we do it so notice that we have the unit of speed which is meters and seconds we need to put the unit meters on the top of the fraction and seconds on the bottom let's make an outline of what we need to do so we need to convert meters to kilomet and kilometers to miles and then we got to convert seconds into minutes and minutes into hours so what's the conversion factor for meters and kilometers there's a th000 meters for every kilometer so the unit meters cancel and we know that between kilometers and miles one mile is equal to 1.609 kilm so kilom cancel now that we have the unit miles we don't need to change that anymore since that's what we want what we do need to change is seconds into hours so because we have the seconds on the bottom it has to be on the top let's convert seconds into minutes there's 60 seconds in 1 minute and there's 60 Minutes in a single hour so the unit seconds cancel and minutes cancel so now we can get the answer so it's going to be 30 / 1,000 * 60 ID 1.609 time another 60 so you should get 67.1 miles hour here's another one convert 25 ft per second into CL km per hour so let's start with 25 ft over seconds we know how to convert seconds into hours but how can we convert feet into kilometers let's convert feet into miles and then we can convert miles into kilom if you recall there's 5,280 ft per mile and we know that there's 1.609 kilm in a single mile so these units cancel and the unit miles cancel and we know there's 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour so seconds cancel minutes cancel as well and so it's going to be 25 / by 5280 * 1.609 * 60 * 60 and you should get 27.4 kilom per hour now the next thing that we need to do is cover the metric system you need to know that Terra corresponds to 10^ 12 power Giga is 10^ the 9th power mega represents 10 6 which is a million 10 9 is a billion kilo is 10 3r which is 1,000 now below kilo you have hecto which is 10 squ or 100 and deca which is 10 1st or 10 and below that you have Desi which is 10us one and then CTI which is 10^ -2 and Millie which is 10us 3 and then micro which is 10 -6 Nano that's 10 9 and Pico is 10 to -12 now from this you need to be able to write the conversion factor so for example 1 km is 10 3 m so you can write it like this 1 km is 1 * 10 3 m that's your conversion factor or if you want to write the conversion factor for micro you can say 1 micrometer or um is equal to 1 * 106 m so how would you write the conversion factor for millimet cm and nanometers so let's start with CM 1 cm is 1 * 10 -2 M if you multiply both sides by 100 you'll get this conversion factor 100 cm is 1 M for millimet we could say 1 mm is 1 * 10 -3 M for nanometers 1 nanometer is 1 * 109 M so there's always a one with the prefix and on the other side the multiplier is always associated with the base unit in this case meters let's try an example let's say if we have 170,000 cm and we wish to convert it to kilometers using the metric system how can we do it what you want to do is you want to convert centim to met and then met to kilm so let's write out the conversion factors 1 kilm is 1 * 10 3 m which is 1,000 m 1 cm is 1 * 102 M these are the two conversion factors that we need so let's start with 170,000 CM over one let's convert it to meters first so the unit centim has to go on a bottom and therefore the unit meters has to go on top using this conversion factor so the unit centimeters will cancel and in the next step we can convert meters into kilometers so we got to put meters on the bottom and kilometers on top so that these units will cancel at this point we could do the math now what's going to happen if we take 10 the 3r and move it to the top x^ -2 is the same as 1x^2 whenever you move an exponent from one side to the other side it change sign so the positive three on the bottom will become -3 when it moves to the top so we can rewrite this as 170,000 * 10 -2 * 10-3 what is 10 -2 * 103 now what is X Cub * x 4 whenever you multiply common bases you are allowed to add the exponents so 3 + 4 is 7 this is X to 7 so therefore 10 -2 * 10-3 is 105 because -2 + -3 is5 so now we need to put the number in appropriate scientific notation we need this number to be between 1 and 10 so we need to with the decimal point five units to the left 1 2 3 4 5 if we do that this is going to increase by five5 + 5 is 0 so it's 1.7 * 10 to 0 anything raised to the zero power is one so the answer is 1.7 km another way you can see it is you need to realize that 170,000 is 1.7 * 100,000 and because 100,000 contains five zeros 100,000 is 10 the 5th and 5 +5 is 0 so you get 10^ 0 which is 1 and so the answer is 1.7 kilm let's try another example try this one convert 380 micromet into CM feel free to pause the video as you work out this example so let's convert micro into meters and then meters to centimeters so the first thing you want to do is write out the conversion factors that you need micro is 10-6 so 1 micrometer is 1 * 106 m C he is 10us 2 so these are the conversion factors that we need so let's start with what we're given and let's convert micrometers into meters so we need to put the unit micrometers on the bottom so that they will cancel and in the next step we need to put the unit meters on the bottom which will give us centim so these units will cancel so now we can do the math so it's going to be 380 * 10-6 and then we're going to take this move it to the top so the -2 will become positive two -6 + 2 is4 so we have 380 * 104 now we need to move the decimal so that it's between the three and the 8 the number has to be between 1 and 10 10 so we need to move a two units to the left whenever you need to move the decimal point to the left you need to increase this number by the number of spaces you move to the left so since we move two units to the left we got to add two to it so it's going to be 3.80 * 10 to the -4 + 2 is -2 so this is the final answer in centim try this one let's say if you have 3.6 * 10 four kilm actually instead of kilm let's make it nanometers convert this number into decimeters so how can you convert 3.6 * 10 4 nanom into decimet so just like before we need to go from nanometers to meters meters to decimet so let's write out the conversion factors that we need 1 n is 1 * 109 M Dei is associated with1 so 1 decimeter is 1 * 10-1 m so let's start with the number that we have and let's convert to meters so we need to put nanometers on the bottom and we got to put 1 * 109 M on top and so meters will have to go on the bottom in the next fraction so that these units cancel and we need to put decimeters on top so let's move this number to the top so what we have is 3.6 * 10 4 * 109 and * 10 POS 1 so 4 + 9 is -55 + 1 is4 so our final answer is 3.6 * 10 to the4 DM notice that we don't need to change this number because 3.6 is between 1 and 10 so it's already in proper scientific notation form let's try this problem an 8.4 g rock was placed in a graduated cylinder that con gain 24.1 M of water the volume went up to 26.2 M calculate the density of the rock the equation for density is mass / volume now let's understand what's happening here so let's say if we have a container that has 24.1 Millers of water and then we're going to add a rock so then the volume is going to increase to 26.2 and so here's the rock what is the volume of the rock so this is how you can find the volume of the rock it's by water displacement the volume of the rock is the difference between these two values so it's 26.2 - 24.1 which is 2.1 so the amount that the volume increases by that's the volume of the Rock and we know the mass of the rock it's given to us it's 8.4 and so 8.4 G / 2.1 gives us a density of 4 or simply four it's 4 G per milliliter now keep in mind 1 m is the same as 1 Cub CM so we already have the density in gr per cub cmet which is the answer to the first part of the question so now we got to find the density in kilog per cubic meter so we need to convert it so what is the conversion between kilog and g 1 kilogram is 1,00 G kilo represents 10 the 3 which is a th and one meter is 100 cm so let's convert it so there's 100 cm in a meter but we need to raise it to the third power because it a three and to convert grams to kilograms there's 1 kilogram per th G so the unit grams cancel and cubic centimet will cancel as well so we have 4 * 100 cub which is 100 * 100 * 100 and then on the bottom we have a th000 so we can cancel three zeros and so what we now have is 4 * 100 * 10 and this is simply one which will not change the value of anything so 4 * 100 is 400 * 10 that's 4,000 so the answer is 4,000 kilg per cubic meter here's another density related unit conversion problem the price of gold is $42 per gram the density of gold is 19.3 G per cubic cmet what is the value of a rectangular gold bar that is 1x 2x 3 in so what's the first thing we need to do how can we find the answer to this problem so notice that we have the the length width and height of the rectangle so we could find the volume so if you were to draw a picture here's a typical rectangle so let's say we have a width of two I mean a width of one height of two and the length of three the volume of a rectangle is length time width time height since we have the volume which is going to be in cubic inches we can convert that to cubic cm and using a density which has grams and cubic centim we can convert it to grams and using the price of gold per gram we can convert that to Dollars and get the value of this particular gold bar so let's go ahead and do that so first let's find the volume so length time width time height 1 * 2 * 3 the volume is 6 cubic in so let's convert it to cubic cenm keep in mind 1 in is equal to 2.54 cm and we need to raise it to the third power so that cubic Ines will cancel now that we have cubic cenm let's use the density to convert it to gr 1 Cub cm is equal to 19.3 grams based on this number and the price of gold is $42 per gram so the unit grams cancel and cubic centimeters so now we can get the answer so it's 6 * 2.5 4 raised to the 3 power * 19.3 * 42 so this particular gold bar is worth $79,700 and12 the next Topic in chemistry that we need to talk about is significant figures so the first thing you need to be able to do is you need to be able to determine the number of significant figures within a number so for example 395 has how many significant figures any nonzero number is always counted as a significant figure so we have three significant figures now what about 407 the only thing you have to worry about is the zeros this zero that's between the four and seven is it significant or is it not in between zeros are always significant so this is counted as three Sig fix now what about 550 so we know the fives are significant and the zero that's between it what about the zero to the right the zeros to the right of a non-zero number are known as trailing zeros trailing zeros are some sometimes significant if there's a decimal point since we don't have a decimal point that particular zero is not significant so we only have three sigic now if we had 5,50 with a decimal point then this zero is counted so we have four Sig fix try these 40 400 how many sig figs are in these numbers so here we have Trail in zero and there's no decimal point so we only have one SigFig the same is true for the next one the two zeros to the right are not counted but now that we have a decimal point the zeros to the right of the four are counted so this is four and this is six all of these are counted now what about these numbers 0147 7 003 05 70 80 01 05 0 and 0400 0 the zeros to the left which are leading zeros are never counted as significant so we could ignore those zeros so here we have an in between zero which is between the four and seven that's counting so we have four Sig fix the zero to the right of the three is counting because we have a decimal point so it's two for the next one we have five Sig fix since we have a decimal point any Zer to the right of a non-zero number are counted and for this one we also have five Sig fix for this one we only have four now what about for scientific notation how many sigfigs are there in these numbers because we have a decimal point those two numbers any zeros to the right will be counted so this is two Sig fix here we have a total of three and here we have four and in this number we have five sigic so in scientific notation since you're usually going to have a decimal point the zeros to the right of a non-zero number will be counted and you don't have to worry about the multiplier that's not related to Sig fix so you can just ignore it now you need to know how to round a number to the appropriate number of significant figures when dealing with multiplication division addition and subtraction so let's say if we have 5.38 * 4.1 for multiplication and division you need to round the final answer to the least number of significant figures the first number has three Sig fix the second one has two so the final answer should only have two Sig fix so first let's get the exact answer 5.38 * 4.1 so the exact answer is 22058 so how can we round this answer to a number that's close to 22.58% 4.13 find the answer and round it to the appropriate number of significant figures so here we have four Sig fix and in this number we have three so first let's get the exact answer which is 21661 and we can stop there so now we got to round this number to three significant figures so the first two numbers are going to remain the same the last one the third one this is what we have to decide should we keep it at six or should we round it up to seven to find the answer look at this number if it's five or more you need to round up so the six is going to go up to a seven so we're going to say 2.17 now you need to understand the rules of addition and subtraction so let's say if you want to add 4.32 1 + 5 6 you need to round to the least number of digits to the right of the decimal point which is here so when you add these two numbers you're going to get 9921 so you need to round to the nearest 10th place so we look at this number since it's less than five we're going to keep it down at N9 if it was greater than five or equal to 5 we would round it up to 10 so the answer for this example is 9.9 now let's say if you have 14753 minus 2.2 this is going to be 336 2 1 that's the exact answer but we need to round it at this position to the nearest hundred's place so since this number is less than five we're going to keep this at three and not round it up to four so the answer is 12.63 so for addition and subtraction line it up for multiplication and division round to the least number of significant figures now the next thing that you need to be able to do is you need to be able to name compounds so for example let's say if you wish to write the name of SC2 and mgcl2 how would you do it mgcl2 is called magnesium chloride SC2 is known as sulfur D chloride so why is it that2 is sulfur D chloride but mg2 is not magnesium D chloride it's simply magnesium chloride why do we use the prefix d for this molecule but we don't do it for this one the reason being is mgcl2 is ionic it's composed of a metal and a non-metal SC2 is non ionic it's a molecular or a equalent compound for molecular and equalent compounds you need to use the prefixes like mono die Tri Tetra and so forth mono represents one die is two Tri is three Tetra is four Penta is five hexa is six HEPA is seven OCTA is eight Nana is nine Deca is 10 for ionic compounds you don't need those prefixes so let's go over the nomenclature of molecular compounds go ahead and name the following compounds so this one is called Tetra phosphorus because there's four phosphorous atoms deoxide Deca is 41 now what about this one SE is selenium we don't have to say mono selenium if the first element contains only one atom simply just write the name of the atom so this is selenium hexa fluoride the last element ends in ID now here we have two nitrogen so we're going to say d nitrogen pent oxide or simply pentoxide now let's work backwards what is the formula for phosphorus Tri chloride and also try these as well what's the formula for carbon monoxide and silicon tetrachloride phosphorus Tri chloride so we have a p and we have a CL but we have three CL since we have the word Tri carbon monoxide so monooxide that means we have one oxygen silicon Tetra chloride Tetra means four four so we have four chlorine atoms so for molecular compounds it's not very difficult to name them or write the formula you simply need to know the names of the first 10 prefixes mono di TR all the way to Deca before we move on to naming ionic compounds we need to go over the names of common monoatomic and polyatomic ions so for example cl4 this is a polyatomic ion it's an ion that contains many atoms poly means many this is called per chlorate cl3 minus this is simply called chlorate per chlorate compared to chlorate simply has one more oxygen cl2 minus is called chlorine eight usually has one more oxygen and I and cl minus is known as hypo chloride hypo means below or less so hypochloride has one less oxygen than chloride CL minus is a monoatomic ion it's an ion composed of one atom mon Atomic ions usually has the suffix ey when you see that there's no Oxygen attached to it when you hear the words eight and I typically that element has some number of oxygens attached to it so42 minus you need to know that this is called sulfate and what do you think s SO3 2 minus is called and S2 minus since s SO3 has one less oxygen than S so4 if s so4 is sulfate s SO3 is sulfite S2 minus is a monoatomic ion so it's going to have the suffix IDE so this is called sulfide what do you think the names for these ions are P4 3us P3 3us P3 minus H P4 2 minus and H2 P4 minus p43 minus is known as phosphate so if you know the first one you could find the rest P3 has one less oxygen so if P4 is phosphate P3 is phosphite P3 minus this is phosphide with the IDE ended hpo42 minus this is hydrogen phosphate H2 P4 minus is dihydrogen phosphate now there are some other you need to know CO3 2 minus this is known as carbonate So based on that what do you think H3 minus is what's the name for this particular polyatomic ion hc3 minus is known as hydrogen carbonate or more commonly bicarbonate now what about oh minus C2 H3 O2 minus c22 2us and CN minus oh minus is known as hydroxide C2 h32 minus this is is called acetate c22 2 minus this is oxalate and the last one CN minus is known as cide but now this's more what about cr4 2 minus CR2 07 2us mn4 minus O2 minus O2 2 minus C4 this is called chromate cr207 that's di chromate and the next one M4 minus is permanganate if you see O2 minus where the individual oxygen has a charge of -2 this is called oxide but if you see o22 minus where each oxygen atom has a charge of negative one so two of them has an overall charge of -2 this is known as peroxide and if you see CO2 with a negative 1 charge meaning each individual oxygen atom has an oxidation state of2 if you divide 1 by two this is known as super oxide so these are the different forms of oxide but the most common is just oxide peroxide you may see that occasionally super oxide is rare now let's go over and naming compounds so let's say if we wish to name NaCl which is an ionic compound it has a metal and a nonmetal so the first element simply write the name na is called sodium now the second element think of the ion that is part of that compound this is CL minus which is called a chloride so the second element has the ID ending if it's a monatomic ion so this is sodium chloride go ahead and name these elements mg o c a s albr R3 and let's see g n and finally ZN F2 so mg mg is known as magnesium n o the second part it's a monoatomic ion so it's going to be called oxide now what about Casas CA is calcium and for the second element we need to add the IDE Anon so instead of saying sulfur we're going to say sulfide now what about albr3 Al is aluminum and BR instead of saying bromine it's bromide now what about the next one Gan GA is called gum and N represents nitride so it's gallium nitride and the last one ZN is zinc and instead of saying F Florine for f it's going to be fluoride the U comes before the O don't put o u it's uo try this b a s so4 let's see l i cl3 K CN NaOH Sr 3 p42 and mg n32 so now we have ionic compounds that contain polyatomic ions if you know the names of the polyatomic ions it's not going to be difficult So ba you need to know the name for ba ba is called barium and so4 is the sulfate ion so this is simply called barium sulfate so that's not too bad so let's try the next one Li is lithium and cl3 as we mentioned before that is chlorine so we have lithium chlorine now what about the next one kcn so what is k k is pottassium and CN is another polyatomic ion and this one is called cyanide very dangerous stuff now what about NaOH na is sodium and the O minus ion that's a polyatomic ion so that's hydroxide now what about the next one sr3 po42 the first element is called stonum and the second one the polyatomic ion you simply need to know that it's phosphate so it's going to help you a lot for the rest of your Chemistry course if you commit the polyatomic ions to memory because when you're working with math problems typically you need to know the formula of the compound so they may give you a name let's say Barum sulfate you need to be able to write the formula calculate the M Mass but if you don't know what sulfate is you can't do the problem so it's going to put you at a serious disadvantage if you don't know the polyatomic ions especially for the rest of your Chemistry course so to put it this way your grade significantly depends on knowing those polyatomic ions your teacher may give you the polyatomic ion sheet on the test but you'll be able to solve the problems faster if you simply know it now what about the last one here we have mg which is magnesium and NO3 is nitrate so it's simply called magnesium nitrate now sometimes you may have compounds that have multiple oxidation States stes which are basically multiple charges and for such compounds you need to specify which charge it has one name in it and you would do that using the Roman numeral system so let's go over the Roman numeral system this number represents one this represents two we have two i's this is three now if you see a v V represents five now if you see like an i to the left of the V it represents subtraction it's like 5 minus 1 so this represents four now if the I is to the right of the V it represents addition 5 + 1 is six so this is 5 + 2 which is s and it's rare that you'll ever need to go past seven so we'll stop there now let's say if we have the formula CU cl2 and cucl so how would you name these two compounds CCL is copper 1 chloride ccl2 is copper 2 chloride well you might be wondering well that's not bad all you need to do is look at the subscript while generally that's going to give you the answer it's not always the case so sometimes this will be the Roman numeral but you can't always rely on it this number means that copper has a plus two charge now chlorine as chloride has a minus one charge and there's two of them so the net negative charge or the total negative charge is minus two and we only have one copper ion so that copper ion has to have a plus two charge to neutralize the two negative charges now for the one on the bottom we only have one chloride ion so this copper only needs a plus one charge to neutralize the negative one charge so because the copper is in a plus one oxidation state it's copper 1 chloride now it turns out there's another way you can calculate the oxidation state of copper and that is by using an equation copper plus two chlorine atoms has to have a net charge of zero notice that there's no overall charge in its compound is neutral if there was an overall charge you'll see like a -2 on the outside or something so we need to solve for the charge on copper so let's put let's replace copper with X and let's substitute negative one with chlorine or chlorine with Nega 1 that's what I meant to say so 2 * 1 is -2 to solve for x we need to add two to both sides so therefore X or copper has an oxidation state or charge of plus two so that's how you can find it for the other example it's going to be CU plus CL which equals z so CL is negative 1 if you add one to both sides you'll see that copper is equal to plus one so it's copper 1 chloride okay let's try FES and Fe 2s3 so for FES do you think it's ron1 sulfide since the subscript is one or is it something else so let's find the oxidation state of Fe sulfur has a negative -2 charge so Fe has to be or has to have a plus two charge since they're in a one to one ratio if you write the equation and if you replace S with -2 you'll see that Fe has a plus two charge so therefore it's not iron one sulfide rather it's iron 2 sulfide so don't always rely on the subscripts it's a good indication of what it may be but always double check it so in this particular case is it iron 3 Sufi or is it something else let's find out now let's write an equation 2 Fe plus 3 S has to add up to zero so s has a charge of -2 3 * -2 is -6 and if we add six to both sides it's going to be 2 Fe which equals plus 6 so the solve for Fe we got to divide by two 6 / 2 is three so in this particular case Fe does have a plus three oxidation state so in this case it is three so it's going to be Iron three sulfide now let's try another example try these PBO and SN O2 so even though lead and Tin are not transition metals they do have multiple oxidation States typically plus2 and plus4 so you know that oxygen has a negative -2 charge that means PB has to have a plus two charge since these two are in the one to one ratio that means the charges are the same even though the sign is opposite so this is going to be called lead to oxide now the one on the bottom let's solve it so we have SN plus 2 oxygen atoms equals to a net charge of zero and each oxygen has a charge of 2 so 2 * -2 is4 if we add four to both sides 10 is in the plus4 oxidation state so this is going to be called 10 4 oxide so now let's talk about how to write the formula of an ionic compound so how would you write the form formula for lithium chloride the first thing you should do is write the ions lithium as an ion has a plus one charge it's an alkaline metal has one valence electron and elements in group 1 a typically form ions with plus one charges chloride is a halogen it's going to have a minus one charge if the charges are the same you can simply write them in the one ratio so another example of this is calcium selenide calcium is an alkaline earth metal with a plus two charge and selenium is a calogen that's below sulfur and it has a minus two charge because the charges are the same you can simply write them in a one to1 ratio another example is aluminum nitride aluminum is in group 3A of the periodic table so it has a plus three charge and nitride is a group 5 a element and it has a minus three charge so here the charges are the same so you can simply write them as a out n so that's the first thing that you want to keep in mind now what about when the charges are different so let's say if we have magnesium bromide magnesium has a plus two charge it's an alkaline earth metal and bromide a halogen has a minus one charge so the charges are different so in this case you can use the crisscross method so this is going to be mg1 br2 but if you have a one you don't really need to write the one so is simply mgbr2 now what about aluminum sing aluminum has a plus three charge and sulfate this is where you need to know your polyatomic ions It's s so42 minus so using the crisscross method it's going to be al2 S so4 3 now whenever you have multiple polyatomic ions you need to enclose it within a parenthesis now what about this one sodium phosphate how would you write the formula for it sodium is an Alkali metal with a plus one charge phosphate is a polyatomic ion which is p43 minus so using the same crisscross method it's going to be na 3 P4 now we don't need to write the one so we can simply leave it as na3 P4 now what about this one lead for sulfide feel free to pause the video and try this example so in this particular case the four tells us that lead has a plus4 charge sulfur has a Nega -2 charge typically and if we use the crisscross method it's going to be PB 2 S4 but notice that we have two even numbers and we don't have the lowest whole number ratio if you can divide it by a whole number you should so if we divide both numbers by two it's going to be pb1 S2 which we could simply write it as PB S2 so this is the case where the subscript is not always the charge as you can see we were able to reduce the subscripts and that's why these two don't match now the next thing that we need to go over is the nomenclature of acids whenever you see a hydrogen to the left of a nonmetal it's an acid now there's some things that you need to know eight is associated with I when writing the name of the acid I is associated with is and and I will have the prefix hydro and the suffix i and for all of these add the word acid so let me give you some examples well let's start with uh h2so4 so h2so4 contains the polyatomic ion sulfate so let's focus on the eight part we know we need to replace it with I so to write the name of the acid write the element first which is sulfur and then add the suffix i and then add the word acid so this is called sulfuric acid not bad right now let's say if we want to name H2 SO3 so notice that it contains the polyatomic ion sulfide so let's focus on the suffix i so we're going to have to replace it with is so let's write the element first sulfur and then let's add the is part to it and then the word acid so this is called suurus acid now what about H2S so s or S2 minus is a monoatomic ion and it's called sulfide so it has the IDE suffix so before we write the element sulfur we need to put the prefix hydro and then let's write the element sulfur and then let's replace I with the suffix i and then let's add the word acid so this is called Hydro sulfuric acid now what about this one hcl4 how would you name this acid feel free to pause the video as you work out this example so the first thing we need to do is identify the polyatomic ion cl4 minus is known as per chlorine so all we need to do is replace the eight part with ick so this is going to be called perchloric and then add the word acid to it so perchloric acid now what about hclo what's the name for this acid so CL is the polyatomic ion hypo chlorite so let's replace I with is so to name the acid it's simply going to be hypo chloris acid now what about HCL how can we name that acid so the anine CL minus is known as chloride because it has an IDE end in we need to add the prefix Hydro and then instead of saying chlorine after the r we're going to add I so hydrochloric acid now we're going to work backwards if you're given the name how can you write the formula for example what is the formula for phosphoric acid so notice that we don't have the prefix Hydro so that means that it's associated with a polyatomic ion we need to replace I with a so this is associated with the phosphate polyatomic ion phosphate is p43 minus once you've identified the ion you simply need to add hydrogens to it because the charge is neg3 we need to add three hydrogens to it so it's going to be H3 P4 so this is the formula for phosphoric acid let's try another one carbonic acid so we don't have the prefix Hydro so it's associated with a polyatomic ion so let's replace I with eight so we need to write the polyatomic ion carbonate carbonate is CO3 2 minus and since it has a -2 charge we got to add two hydrogen to it so the name of carbonic acid or the formula for it is h23 now what about this one Hydro bromic acid so because we have the prefix hydro and the suffix i It's associated with I or bromide and bromide is a monoatomic ion which is BR minus because it has a Nega one charge we only need to add one hydrogen to it so the formula for hydrobromic acid is simply hbr now what about iotic acid what's the formula for it so there's no Hydro so it's a polyatomic ion that contains oxygen and if we replace the I part with eight It's associated with the polyatomic ion iodate now now chlorate was cl3 minus iodate is io3 minus the Helens they follow a similar Trend so to write the formula for iodic acid because we have a negative one charge we only need to add one hydrogen so it's going to be hio3 now here's the last one acetic acid so if we replace a with eight this is associated with acetate acetate is C2 h321 so we need to add one hydrogen to it so the formula is hc2 h32 so that's the formula for acetic acid now the next thing that we need to talk about in chemistry is grams moles atoms things like that now Mass represents the quantity of matter and in chemistry mass is usually measured in grams 1 kilogram is 1,000 gr now what about moles what is a mole the best way to understand what a mole is is to compare it with a dozen a dozen is simply a quantity a dozen represents 12 a dozen eggs is 12 eggs a dozen calculators 12 calculators a dozen is to 12 the same way as a mole is to a very large number a number called avag God's number which is 6.02 * 10 23 so if you have a mole of pencils you have 6 * 10^ 23 pencils if you have a mole of atoms you have 6 * 10 to 23 atoms and so a mole is just a very large quantity now there's something called molar mass molar mass is the ratio between the mass and the moles it's grams over moles and in the periodic table you'll see this number below carbon which is 12.01 the average atomic mass of carbon or you could simply say atomic mass this is also the M mass of carbon and the units for M mass is 12.01 G per Mo so as you can see molar mass is simply the mass divided by moles gr over moles now let's say if you wanted to calculate the mol mass for CH4 how would you do it all you need to do is add up the atomic masses for every atom in that molecule carbon has an atomic mass of 12.01 and for hydrogen it's about 1 1.8 but times 4 since we have four hydrogens so let's round it and let's say this is 12 and hydrogen is one so the M mass of methane is about 16 G per mole calculate the molar mass for sodium hydroxide and for glucose so the atomic mass for na is 23 for oxygen is 16 for hydrogen it's 1 so sodium hydroxide has a m mass of 40 G per Mo so what this means is that one mole of sodium hydroxide has a mass of 40 G so 2 moles of sodium hydroxide will have a mass of 80 g so mol mass is simply the ratio between grams and moles now what about the M mass of glucose C6 h126 now what's the answer so there's six carbon atoms each with an atomic mass of 12 there's 12 hydrogen atoms which has an atomic mass of one and six oxygen atoms each with an atomic mass of 16 6 and 12 is 72 and 6 * 16 is 96 72 and 12 that's 84 and 84 and 96 that's 180 so the mol mass of glucose is 180 g per mole so one mole of glucose ose has a mass of 180 g 2 moles of glucose has a mass of 360 G 3 moles of glucose has a mass of 540 G and you can see a pattern there now the next thing we need to talk about is mass percent if you want to find the mass percent of an element in a compound is simply the mass of the element divide by the total masstimes 100% so for example let's say if we want to find the mass percent of carbon in methane so the atomic mass of carbon is 12 now the total atomic mass is the mass of carbon plus the mass of the four hydrogen atoms times 100% so it's 12 out of 16 * 100% And so you're going to get 75% carbon now if you want to find let's say the percent of hydrogen it's going to be the mass of hydrogen or the mol mass of hydrogen divided by the total mass 4 out of 16 * 100% is 25% so it's 25% hydrogen 75% carbon notice that the total percentage is 100% so now it's your turn calculate the percent by mass of sodium in sodium hydroxide so we know the molecular mass or the atomic mass of sodium is 23 the formula mass of the NaOH formula unit we calculated that already it was 23 + 16 + 1 which is 40 so at this point if you type it in 23 40 * 100 you should get a mass percent of 57.5% so that's the percent of sodium in this compound now how much or what is the percent of hydrogen in sodium hydroxide so the mass of hydrogen is 1id by a total mol mass of 40 so it's 1 out of 40 * 100 so it's 2.5% % by mass for hydrogen now what about for oxygen since oxygen is the last element we could simply do 100 minus 57.5 - 2.5 or 100 - 60 so that means that it's 40% oxygen because the three percentages they have to add up to 100% so if you typed in 16 out of 40 times 100 you should get 40% for the sake of practice let's try another example let's use glucose find the mass percent of carbon in this compound so the mass of carbon there's six carbon atoms so 6 * 12 that's the total M mass of all the carbon atoms in glucose now the total M mass for all of the atoms in glucose is 6 * * 12 + 12 + 6 * 16 * 100% so the 6 carbon atoms has a m mass of 72 the M mass of the entire compound is 180 and so now we just got to type these numbers in the calculator and so it's 40% by mass for carbon so now you know how to find the mass percent of an element within a compound now the next thing that we need to talk about is converting GRS into moles so for example let's say if you have 48 G of carbon how many moles of carbon is this equivalent to so whenever you want to convert from grams to moles or moles to GRS you need the M Mass based on a periodic table the M mass of carbon is 12 so what that means is that one Mo of carbon has a mass of 12 G so let's convert start with what you have now since we have grams of carbon on the upper left side we need to put grams of carbon on the bottom so 12 is associated with it and so one Mo of carbon is going to go on top so that these units cancel so it's simply 48 over2 which is equivalent to 4 moles of carbon now let's make sense of it so the molar mass is 12 and as we mentioned before one Mo of carbon is equal to 12 G so 2 mol of carbon is equal to 24 G 3 mol of carbon is equal to 36 G so for every mole of carbon that you add the mass increases by 12 so four moles of carbon equates to 48 G of carbon which is the answer that we wanted now try this example so let's say if you have 22 G of carbon dioxide go ahead and convert it to moles of CO2 so the first thing you need to do is find the mol mass of CO2 the atomic mass of carbon is 12 and for oxygen is 16 but there's two of them so 16 * 2 is 32 + 12 that's 44 so the M mass is 44 G per mole so now let's start with what we're given and we need to put GRS on the bottom so there 44 G of CO2 per 1 Mo of CO2 so whenever you need to convert from GRS to moles take the mass in gr and simply divide it by the M Mass so 22 ID 44 is .5 so we have 0.5 moles of CO2 now if you need to go the other way let's say if you want to convert from moles to gr you need to multiply the moles by the M Mass so let's say if we have 3 moles of neon let's convert it to gr of neon so let's start with what we're given now if you use the uh prct table if you take a look at it you'll see that the atomic mass of neon is approximately I'm going to round it it's about 20 G per mole so there's 20 G of neon per 1 Mo of neon so you want to set it up in such a way that the unit moles of neon cancels and so since we have two numbers on top we got to multiply 3 * 20 is 60 so you're going to get 60 G of neon try this one let's say if you have five moles of c2h6 molecules convert this into grams of C2 H6 c2h6 is ethane so let's find The M Mass first so we have two carbons each with an atomic mass of 12 and six hydrogens each with a atomic mass of one so 2 and 12 is 24 + 6 is 30 so it's 30 G per mole so let's start with 5 moles of ethane let's convert it to grams so there's 30 gr of ethane per one mole of ethane therefore the unit moles of ethane will cancel and so it's 5 * 30 we know 5 * 3 is 15 so 5 * 30 is 150 you got to add the zero so we have 150 g of ethane so that's how you can convert from to G using M Mass so if you want to write an equation the moles is equal to well let's actually write it this way mass in gr is equal to the molar mass times the moles so let's use lowercase M for mass and let's use C capital M for M mass and N for moles be careful though capital M sometimes could be marity so watch out for that so mass is mol mass time moles now let's say if you have three moles of carbon atoms how can we convert that to the number of carbon atoms so if you have three moles of carbon how many atoms do we have so to answer this question we need to use avag God's number 1 mole is equal to 6 * 10 23 it's really 6.022 * 10 23 but I'm going to round it to 6 * 10 23 so let's start with three moles of carbon 1 Mo of carbon is equal to 6 * 10 23 atoms of carbon so that's how you can convert from moles to atoms simply multiply by avag God's number so the answer is 6 * 3 that's 18 so it's 18 * 10 the 23 atoms now to put it in proper scientific notation we need a number between 1 and 10 18 is greater than 10 so let's move the decimal one unit to the left anytime you move the decimal one unit to the left the exponent needs to go up by one so you have to add one to 23 so it's 1.8 * 10 to the 24 atoms of carbon now let's say if we have four moles of methane how many molecules of methane do we have and how many atoms of hydrogen do we have so let's find molecules of methane so methane is not an atom you can't go directly from four moles of CH4 to atoms because this is a molecule a mo Ule is a particle that is composed of many atoms so when using avagadro's number one mole of methane corresponds to 6 * 10 23 not atoms of methane but molecules of methane since CH4 is a molecule so if we simply multiply 4X 6 * 10 23 that's all we need to do to get the molecules of CH4 so that's going to be 24 * 10 23 which is the same as 2.4 * 10^ 24 molecules of CH4 now if we want to find the atoms of hydrogen we need to take it one step further in one molecule of CH4 you need to realize that there's four atoms of hydrogen because of the subscript 4 so 4 * 6 is 24 24 * 4 if 20 * 4 is 80 4 * 4 is 16 80 and 16 is 96 so 24 * 4 is 96 so it's 96 * 10^ 23 atoms of hydrogen which is the same as 9.6 * 10 to 24 atoms so this is the answer so that's how you can go from moles to molecules to atoms now sometimes you may need to convert from grams to atoms so let's say if you have 16 G of helium convert it to atoms of helium now helium is not a molecule it's made up of atoms so we don't need that extra step to go from molecules to atoms but first before we can go to atoms we need to convert grams to moles and then moles to atoms you can't go directly from grams to atoms so to go from grams to moles we need the M Mass the atomic mass or M mass of helium is about four it's four G per mole so 4 G of helium equates to one Mo of helium so these units cancel and now we can convert moles to atoms one Mo of helium is 6 * 10 to the 23 atoms of helium so it's going to be 16 / 4 which is 4 4 * 6 is 24 so 24 * 10 23rd is 2.4 * 10^ the 24th atoms of helium now let's say if you have 3 * 10 to the 23 atoms of argon and let's say you want to convert that to grams of argon try that example so first we need to convert atoms into moles and we can use alagad number so one Mo of argon atoms is equal to 6 * 10 23 atoms so the unit atoms cancel and now we can go from moles to GRS the M mass for Argon is about 40 so there's 40 gr of argon for every mole of argon so those units disappear so now let's do the math we can cancel the 10^ the 23r because they're the same 3 / 6 is a half and half of 40 is 20 so the answer is 20 G of argon so now you know how to convert from atoms to grams now let's uh switch gears and go to uh reactions you need to be able to classify the different types of reactions and you need to know how to balance it so let's start with combustion reaction so let's say if you have propane which is C3 h8 and we're going to react it with oxygen gas if you see carbon hydrogen and oxygen this is going to be a combustion reaction the products of a combustion reaction are typically CO2 and water now to balance a reaction your goal is to make sure that the atoms on the left side and on the right side are the same and to make it equal you can modify the coefficients of the reaction the coefficients are the numbers in front of the substances the subscripts are the small numbers like the three the eight the two those are the subscripts you can't change those when balancing the equation you can only change it when writing a formula but when you're balancing an equation you can only add subscripts I mean not subscripts but coefficients which are the number in front of these molecules when balancing in a combustion reaction the first thing that you want to do is balance the carbon atoms so we have three carbon atoms on the left therefore we got to put a three in front of CO2 now the next thing you want to move to is the hydrogen atoms we have eight on the left two on the right 8 ID two is four so let's put a four in front of H2O now you want to save the oxygen atoms for last so 3 * 2 is 6 so we have six oxygen atoms in the three CO2 molecules four times this invisible one is four so we have four oxygen atoms in the four water molecules 6 and four is 10 so we have a total of 10 oxygen atoms on the right side so what number do we need to put in front of o2 to balance it well 10 ID by the subscript 2 is five so we need a five in front of o2 and since we don't need a number here we could put a one and now the reaction is balanced we have three carbon atoms on both sides 10 oxygen atoms and eight hydrogen atoms on both sides so that's how you can balance a combustion reaction now let's try another example c2h5 which is known as ethanol plus O2 produces carbon dioxide and water go ahead and balance this particular combustion reaction to notice that we have two carbon atoms on the left side we need to put a two in front of water and we have a total of six hydrogen atoms 5 + 1 is 6 6 / 2 is 3 so we need to put a three in front of H2O to notice that we have four oxygen atoms from the two CO2 molecules and three oxygen atoms from the three water molecules 4 + 3 is 7 now notice that we already have an oxygen atom in ethanol so what number do we need to put in front of O2 since we already have one oxygen atom on the left side in ethanol we need six oxygen atoms from the O2 molecule because 1 + 6 is 7 so 6 / the 2 is 3 therefore we need to put a three in front of o2 so notice that we have a total of seven oxygen atoms on both sides so we have 4 and 3 which is 7 1 and 3 * 2 which is six so six and one is seven so everything is balanced we have two carbon atoms on both sides six hydrogen atoms and seven oxygen atoms by the way are combustion reactions considered to be Redux reactions what would you say consider this reaction butane plus oxygen produces CO2 and water here's another combustion reaction it turn turns out that every combustion reaction is a redox reaction a redox reaction is simply a reaction where electrons are being transferred from one element to another a quick way to determine if a reaction is a Redux reaction is to look at the substances in the reaction on the left side we have the reactants on the right side you have the products if you see a Pure Element on one side of the reaction and that ele element in the compound then it's a reduxx reaction so here we have a Pure Element and here's a compound if you see that it's definitely going to be Redux now how would you balance this combustion SL redox reaction so let's start with the carbon atoms we have four on the left so we need to put a four in front of CO2 now we have 10 hydrogens on the left side 10 / 2 is 5 so we need to put five in front of H2O now how many oxygen atoms do we have on the right side so we have eight and five which is 13 13 / 2 is 13 / 2 so notice that we have a fraction whenever you get a situation like this simply multiply everything by two so it's going to be 2 C4 h10 now 13 over 2 * 2 the twos cancels and you're just going to get 13 so it's going to be 1302 and then 8 CO2 plus 10 H2O so notice that the reaction is now balanced we have a total of eight carbon atoms 20 hydrogen atoms 10 * 2 is 20 and 26 oxygen atoms 8 and two is 16 plus the 10 from water that adds up to 26 so everything is balanced in this particular reaction here's the reaction for you when zinc is mixed with elemental bromine what's going to happen what product will be produced this is a combination reaction if you make A and B and you get a single product that's known as a combination reaction not every combination reactions are Redux reactions some are some are not now if you mix a metal and a nonmetal these two would react in such a way to produce an ionic compound zinc is going to give up its electrons and it's going to turn into the zinc plus two cation bromine is going to acquire the electron and it's going to turn into bromide to write the formula of the product simply use the crisscross method so it's going to be zn1 br2 which we're simply going to write ZN br2 and the reaction is already balanced so is this reaction a Redux reaction notice that we have zinc as a Pure Element and zinc within a compound so when you see that a Pure Element on the left Compound on the right or vice versa it's a redox reaction now which substance is oxidized and which substance is reduced so you need to look at something called oxidation States the oxidation state of any Pure Element is always zero now in zinc bromide we know that zinc has a plus two charge Elemental bromine has an oxidation state of zero but bromide in zc bromide individually has an oxidation state of negative 1 because bromide typically forms a negative 1 charge whenever the oxidation state increases the substance is oxidized so the oxidation state of zinc went from0 to plus2 so zinc was oxidized the substance that is oxidized is always a reactant never the product so it's always on the left side now bromine was reduced notice that the oxidation state decreased or was reduced from 0 to1 so br2 was reduced the substance that is oxidized is known as the reducing agent and the substance that is reduced is the oxidizing agent zinc is the reducing agent because it caused the other substance bromine to be reduced bromine is the oxidizing agent because it caused the other substance zinc to be oxidized Metals most metals particularly the active ones are usually good reducing agents because they like to give away electrons nonmetals like bromine are oxidizing agents because they like to take away electrons whenever a substance gives away or loses electrons it is oxidized a substance that receives or gain electrons is set to be reduced now let's say if we were to mix calcium oxide and water calcium oxide is a basic and hydde metal oxides are considered basic and hydrates because when you add them to water they turn into a base calcium oxide reacts with water to produce calcium hydroxide whenever you see a metal with an O It's a base bases produces hydroxide ions in solution so notice that this is a combination reaction it's in the form a a plus b turns into a now this particular combination reaction which is already balanced is it a Redux reaction or is it not notice that there's no pure elements in this reaction we have a compound compound compound if you don't see a Pure Element it's safe to say this is not a Redux reaction so there's no transfer of electrons in this reaction now let's say if you were to have calcium carbonate and if you add heat to it metal carbonates they decompose when you add Heat this is going to turn into calcium oxide and it's going to release a volatile component that is contained in calcium carbonate that volatile component is carbon dioxide gas whenever you add heat if a gas can escape it will escape now what kind of reaction do we have here so we have the reverse of a combination reaction we have a larger product breaking down into two smaller components so this is known as decomposition now is it Redux or is it not a redox reaction notice that we have a compound compound compound no pure elements so it's not a reduxx reaction now let's say if we have magnesium nitride which is a solid if we add heat to it what's going to happen typically whenever you add heat to a compound if it's enough if it's like a lot of heat it can decompose if there's a gas that can be produced then the formation of the gas is going to drive the reactions to the right making it spontaneous when you heat magnesium nitride it's going to turn into magnesium metal and nitrogen gas nitrogen gas is very stable so heat is going to drive the reaction to the right producing this volatile gas to balance it we simply need to put a three in front of mg so is this a reduxx reaction or is it not so we know this is a decomposition reaction we have a compound breaking into its elements and it turns out it is a reduxx reaction here we have a compound and here we have a Pure Element so it's a reduxx reaction now there are some other common decomposition reactions that you should know the decomposition of potassium per chlorine if you had heat to it this breaks down into potassium chloride and oxygen another one is mercury oxide which is a solid if you add heat it's going to turn into Mercury metal which is a liquid and you're going to get oxygen gas so notice that heat favors the formation of a gas if a gas can be form is going to drive the reaction to the right making it spontaneous so both of these are decomposition reactions now are they Redux reactions if you look at the first one we have a compound and here we have a Pure Element so it's a redo reaction for the second one compound Pure Element Redux to balance the first one notice that we have three oxygen on the left two on the right the least common multiple of two and three is six so to make them equal we need to get six oxygen atoms on both sides so we need to put a two in front of K3 and a three in front of o2 so we have six oxygen atoms on both sides notice that we have two potassium atoms so we got to put a two in front of KCl now it's balanced for mercury oxide all we got to do is put a two and a two and it's balanced so we have two Mercury atoms and two oxygen atoms now we said that whenever you have a metal oxide with water it's going to produce a base so metal oxides are basic and hydrides now what about non-metal oxides like sulfur dioxide non-metal oxides are acid and hydrides because when you put them in water they will turn into an acid so SO2 plus water turns into H2S SO3 if you put sulfur trioxide in water it's going to turn into sulfuric acid if you mix carbon dioxide with water it turns into carbonic acid so as you can see nonmetal oxides are acid and hydrides metal oxides are basic and hydrates now let's say if you have calcium hydroxide if you add heat you're going to get the reverse reaction of what we had in the last example example this is going to break down into calcium oxide and water now depending on the temperature water can escape as a liquid or if it's hot enough it could leave as Steam now let's say if you have a single replacement reaction zinc plus actually let's change it let's make it aluminum plus hydroc choric acid what are the products of this single replacement reaction aluminum is going to displace hydrogen out of the solution and it's going to pair up with cl aluminum is going to lose his three electrons turning into the aluminum plus three ion and chloride usually has a minus one charge so using the crisscross method when these two get together they turn into Al cl3 now when hydrogen is displaced out of the solution it's going to be Elemental hydrogen which is diatomic and it's going to leave us gas aluminum is a solid HCL is aquous which means that it's dissolved in water aluminum chloride will also be in aquous Phase so in this reaction we're placing a solid chunk of aluminum in a solution of HCL which means the HCL is mixed with water so whenever you see AQ that means that is dissolved in water now this single replacement reaction is it a redox reaction it turns out that all single replacement reactions are reduxx reactions notice that we have a pure element and a compound so it's a reduxx reaction now which substance is oxidized and which one is reduced so aluminum is in the zero oxidation state because it's Pure Element but in this compound is+ three now hydrogen is in the +1 oxidation state because chlorine is minus one whenever hydrogen is bonded to a non-metal it usually has a plus one charge but when it's bonded to a metal it usually has a minus one oxidation state or charge now Elemental hydrogen is zero so aluminum goes from 0 to three so the oxidation state goes up so alum aluminum was oxidized now hydrogen in HCL it went down or it was reduced from 1 to zero so HCL was reduced since aluminum was oxidized aluminum is also known as the reducing agent hydrogen was reduced so it's called the oxidizing agent so as we can see here most active metals are reducing agents and non-metals are usually oxidizing agents going back to this reaction a quick way to distinguish a single replacement reaction from let's say a double replacement reaction is this method in a single replacement reaction typically you have an element reacting with a compound when you see that it's usually a single replacement reaction by the way how would you balance this reaction what would you do to balance it so notice that we have three chlorine atoms so we're probably going to have to put a three in front of HCL but notice that we have an odd number of hydrogens and an even number over here the least common multiple between three and two is six so that tells us that we need six hydrogen atoms so let's put a three here to make it six and let's put a six there and let's rebalance it so now that we have we have six hydrogen atoms in both sides let's balance the chlorine atoms we have six on the left three on the right so we need to put a two in front of alcl3 and so since we have two aluminum atoms on the right side we got to put a two in front of Al now the reaction is balanced now consider this reaction let's say if we have an aquous solution of silver nitrate plus magnesium chloride and we want to find out what the products for this reaction will be nitrates are always soluble so this is going to be aquous to know this you need to understand the solubility rules nitrates acetates ammonium which is nh4+ are always soluble alkaline metals like lithium sodium potassium rubidium they're always soluble the halides like chloride bromide iodide are generally soluble except with silver lead and Mercury so with magnesium chloride is soluble now this is a double replacement reaction we have a compound reaction with a compound in a single replacement reaction it's an element plus a compound in a double replacement reaction the two groups on the outside are going to pair up together and the two on the middle are going to pair up so AG is going to pair up with cl so we have ag1 and cl minus one because these two have the same charge even though the sign is opposite we can write them in a one: one ratio now chloride is soluble with everything except silver lead and Mercury so silver is an exception so this is a solid whenever you mix two aquid solutions together and if you get a solid product this double replacement reaction is also known as a precipitation reaction which is what we have in this particular case and now we need to find the other product so let's pair up magnesium with nitrate magnesium is an alkaline earth metal with a plus two charge and nitrate is a polyatomic ion with a minus one charge using the crisscross method we could see that it's mg1 n32 whenever you have multiple polyatomic ions make sure you enclose the polyatomic ion within a parenthesis now we said nitrates are always soluble so magnesium nitrate is going to be Aquis so now what we need to do at this point is balance the reaction so we have two nitrates on the right side so we got to put a two in front of H3 and we have two chlorines on the left side so we need a two in front of HCL and now the reaction is balanced now this particular double replacement reaction would you consider it a Redux reaction what would you say notice that there's no Pure Element in this compound I mean not compound but there's no Pure Element in this reaction this is a compound that's a compound compound compound so double replacement reactions are never Redux reactions because you won't see any pure elements in this reaction now typically with double replacement reactions you need to be able to write the net ionic equation how can we do that and it's particular example the first thing that you need to do is write the total ionic equation so everything that is in the aquous phase we need to separate it into ions except the solid so we have two ag+ ions and two nitr ions in ag3 in this compound mgcl2 we have a magnesium ion and two chloride ions agcl is a solid so we're going to leave it that way everything that we separate into ions all of these are in the aquous phase by the way and then magnesium nitrate we could separate that into mg+ 2 or mg2+ and two nitrate ions if you're submitting this into an online assignment typically instead of writing plus two you may have to write two plus now this is the total ionic equation our next step is to eliminate The Spectator ions The Spectator ions are those that do not participate in a reaction they just spectate they watch so on a reaction they look exactly the same the nitrate ions are spec ions we can cancel them out and magnesium is a specon so what remains is the net ionic equation which is 2 ag+ plus 2 CL minus produces two agcl notice that each of these has a coefficient of two which means we could divide each 1 by two so it simplifies to this ag+ which is in the aquous phase and cl minus which is also in the Aquas phase these two will react to produce solid silver chloride so this is the net ionic equation for this example now let's try another double replacement reaction what's going to happen if we mix sodium hydroxide with sulfuric acid so this is an acidbase neutralization reaction when you mix a strong base with a strong acid they will react to produce salt and water but it's still a double replacement reaction which means it's not a Redux reaction so the two on the outside will pair up sodium has a plus one charge and sulfate has a -2 charge which is important for you to know the polytomic iist because without that you won't be able to write the correct formula for sulfate if you don't know the right charge and you won't be able to write the net anic equation so you have to make sure you know your polyatomic ions so if we paare these two ions together it's going to be na 2 so41 or just s so4 so that's one of products that we have to find the other product whenever you pair H with o these two will just create water this is something that you should just know or commit to memory so now we have a balanced reaction well we just have a reaction but we got to balance it so notice that we have two sodium atoms on the right side so we got to put a two in front of NaOH now to balance acid base reactions here's what you can do to quickly get the answer notice that you have two hydroxide ions two H+ ions that's going to produce two water molecules it's always going to work out that way so this is a one so now the reaction is balanced so before we can write the net ionic equation we need to write the phases of every substance so typically the stuff on the left for a double replacement reaction is usually in aquous phase sodium hydroxide is soluble in water na is an alkaline metal alkaline metals are always soluble now acids for the most part are soluble in water I never seen an acid that doesn't dissolve in water and water is a liquid so to write the total ionic equation everything that's in the aquous phase we need to separate into ions so we're going to have two na+ ions from o and two hydroxide ions now in the next compound suric acid we have two H+ ions and one sulfate ion in sodium sulfate there are two sodium ions and a sulfate ion and water is a liquid so it's not aquous therefore we need to leave it the way it is so what are The Spectator ions in this total ionic equation so which ions look exactly the same on both sides so that's sodium and so now we can write the net ionic equation but notice that we have two hydroxides 2 H+ two water molecules so every coefficient is two let's divide the coefficients by two so it's going to be one hydroxide which is the aquous phase plus one H+ ion or hydrogen ion in aquous phase and this is going to produce liquid water so this is the net ionic equation for this acid base neutralization reaction so that is it for this video by the way look out for my other videos on YouTube particularly the ones on stochiometry I've created one that's entitled stereometry grams moles atoms molecules it also has examples on limiting and excess reactants percent yield retical yield things like that and I've created another one on solution stochiometry where it goes over mity calculations and how to convert from grams to moles to marity to liters and things like that and how to do dilution problems using the M1 V1 m2v2 equations so take a look at those videos when you get a chance it continues from where we left off and that's all I got for today so thanks for watching I hope you found this video to be educational and have a great day"

        "transcription": "Hello, I'm Hank Green; welcome to Crash Course\nChemistry. Today, we're talking about the most important\ntable ever. Not the table where they signed the Declaration\nof Independence, nor any table of contents, nor this table\nright here, nor the stone table of Aslan, NAY! It is the periodic table of elements, a concise, information-dense catalog of all of the different\nsorts of atoms in the universe. Today I want to talk a little bit about the\ncreation of this table, which is, to be clear, one of the crowning\nachievements of human thought. To start out, though, let's close our eyes\nand pretend. [Theme Music] Imagine you're in Siberia. And you're a thirteen-year-old\nboy. And your father, who was a professor but had\ngone blind, leaving your family of more than ten brothers and sisters destitute, has just died. I know, downer. Your mom, to support the family, has re-opened an abandoned glassmaking factory in the small town where you live, largely because she wants to make enough money\nto send you to school someday. A year passes - the factory burns down. But your mom, she sees your potential; she knows that you have a keen scientific\nmind and will not see that squandered. So, with your siblings out of the house and on their own, she packs up your belongings, straps them to a horse, and with you in tow, rides 1200 miles through the Ural Mountains on horseback to a university in Moscow. There, on your behalf, she pleads earnestly\nand effectively, and they reject you. So together, you ride another 400 miles to\nSt. Petersburg, to the school where your father had graduated\nas a scientist, and as luck, or extreme, insane, undeniably Russian persistence, would have it, they accept you, and your saddle-worn butt, as a pupil. Your mother, having completed her mission, promptly dies. If you're doing your imagining as I told you,\nyou might feel a tremendous debt to your mother, and a very deep desire to ensure that you achieve something on par with the sacrifices she made for you. And maybe that's one reason why Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev became the crown jewel of Russian science, and a theorist who revolutionized how we see\nthe world. Mendeleev spent a great deal of time in laboratories as a student, studying the burgeoning new field of chemistry. He worked with all the elements that you could\nwork with at the time, and his knowledge gave him unique insights\ninto their properties. Those insights would come in handy. Let's all imagine we're Mendeleev again - I like doing that - and that we know a bunch of stuff about chemistry - which, you know, we don't, yet - but we're\nimagining. So it's the 1860s, and about 60 elements are\nknown to mankind, and their atomic weights are mostly known\nas well. So the simplest thing was just to sort them\nin order of their atomic weights. But interestingly, you, because you're a cleverpants, realized that the most significant relationships\nseem to have nothing to do with the atomic weight. Lithium, sodium, potassium, and rubidium were\nall extremely prone to reacting with chlorine, fluorine, iodine, and bromine; beryllium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium\nwere all similar, but less reactive. But with a quick inspection, you, and to be\nfair, a number of other chemists, realize that there was a relationship between\natomic weights, but it's periodic. At the beginning of the list of elements,\ncharacteristics repeat every seven elements. On the side here, we now know that it's every\neight elements, but in the 1860s, elements were studies based\non their reactivity, so the non-reactive noble gases had not yet\nbeen discovered, so the period occurred every As the mass of the elements increases, the\nrepetition starts to get a little less periodic, although it's certainly still there; it just\nisn't perfect. Some of your colleagues, they're saying: \"Well,\nsuch is life.\" It was perfect repetition early on, but later\nin the list it gets a little fuzzier. But not you; you become obsessed. Obsessed\nwith the perfection of the periodicity. You write out the names and weights and properties\nof elements on cards; you lay them across your desk, shuffle them, tear them to pieces in frustration, until one day, you realize: that you're simply missing cards. The numbers aren't working, not because there's\nsomething wrong with your ideas, but because some elements simply haven't been\ndiscovered yet. Armed with this insight, you insert gaps into the table, and things suddenly fall perfectly into place. Seven-element periods for the first two rows,\nwith hydrogen in its own category, eighteen-element periods for the next two\nrows. You're so certain that you predict the properties\nof these missing elements. And when a French scientist comes along and says that he has, in fact, discovered one of them, you argue with him, saying that you discovered\nit first in your mind. And when you see his data, and it doesn't\nmatch yours, you publish a paper saying his data for the\nnew element he discovered is wrong. That's how certain you are of yourself of this beautiful new theoretical framework you've created. And you know what the really crazy thing is?\nYou're right! That French guy's data was wrong! You, never having examined the element he\ndiscovered, knew more about it than he did, because you are Mendeleev, Master of the Elements. Okay, we're done imagining for the episode;\nthat was fun though. Different groups Mendeleev had identified are a lot of the same groups that we study today. Starting at the left, we have the soft, shiny,\nextremely reactive alkali metals, so reactive, in fact, that they have to be\nstored in inert gases or oil, to prevent them from reacting with the atmosphere. Alkali metals want nothing more than to dump off an electron and form a positive ion, or cation. And they're always jonesing to hook up with\na hottie from the other side of the table. So of course, seeing as they're so reactive, you don't find hunks of them lying around in nature; instead, chemists must extract them from compounds\ncontaining them. Next, you have the alkaline earth metals - reactive metals, but not as reactive as the alkali metals, forming cations with two positive charges\ninstead of just one. Calcium, shown here, undergoes a very similar\nreaction to sodium with water, just a little more slowly, producing a little\nless heat. The middle body area of the table is made up of a nice, solid rectangle of transition metals, these are the metals you think of as metal,\nwith iron, and nickel, and gold, and platinum. The majority of elements are metals - they're\nfairly unreactive, great conductors of heat, but more importantly for us, good conductors\nof electricity. They're malleable, and can be bent and formed\nand hammered into sheets, and they're extremely important in chemistry\nbut overall surprisingly similar to each other. On the far right, just over from the noble\ngases, the halogens make up a set of extremely reactive\ngases that form negative ions, or anions, with one negative charge, and love to react\nwith the alkali and alkaline earth metals. The rectangle between the halogens and the\ntransition metals contain a peculiar scatter shot of metals, metalloids, gases, and nonmetals; these guys don't end up as ions unless you take extreme action and start shooting other ions at them, so generally a bit boring over here, though\nlots of interesting covalent organic chemistry (we'll get to that). Down below, in their own little island, are\nthe lanthanides and actinides, metals that were largely undiscovered in Mendeleev's\nday because they're so similar that it's next\nto impossible to separate them from each other. And finally, on the far, far right, also undiscovered\nwhen Mendeleev built his chart, the completely unreactive noble gases. Like a lot of other obsessive scientists, Mendeleev never thought he was done with his table, so he held it back for quite a while, only\npublishing it as part of a new chemistry textbook he was working on as a way to make some quick\ncash that he needed. And, as with many other scientific revelations, there were a number of other people hot on this discovery's trail. As many as six people published on the periodicity\nof elements at roughly the same time as Mendeleev, but a few things set him apart. 1. He was obsessive. He knew the data better than anyone else, and had spent a ton of time working on a theory that many people thought was just an interesting little quirk. And 2. he realized in a way no one else did that the idea of periodicity had far-reaching consequences. It seems as if he had a deep belief in the\ncosmic importance of what he was doing, almost of religious fascination. Mendeleev believed in God but also he believed that organized religions were false paths to the unknowable nature of God. I like to believe that he thought he saw some\ndivine pattern in his tables, and Mendeleev felt as if he was coming to\nknow God in a way that no other man had. To be clear, this is pure conjecture. And as we now know, the periodicity of elements\nis a physical phenomenon. It's a function of electrons, which are in some ways pretty dang peculiar, but certainly not at all mystical. But we'll get to that peculiar physical reality\nin the next episode. The periodic table that we know and love - I\nlove it anyway - if a representation of reality; a way of understanding and sorting the universe\nas it exists. But that form of the table is not by any means\nset in stone; indeed, a contemporary of Mendeleev envisioned\nthe table set onto a screw, or cylinder, with the elements wrapping around from one\nside to another. While Mendeleev's table looks more like a\nmap up on a wall, de Chancourtois, a geologist, envisioned more\nof a globe. Unfortunately for de Chancourtois, no publisher could figure out how to print his cylindrical 3D table, and so he published his paper without a graphical representation of his Periodic Cylinder of the Elements, and it was largely ignored. I guess they didn't have paper craft back\nthen. I am a huge fan of this cut-and-tape model\nof the periodic table; you can make your own - there's a link in\nthe description - and there are also a ton of other designs\nfor periodic tables that have various advantages over the one\nthat we're all familiar with. Our periodic table, as it stands, it really\na little bit unhappy with itself, frankly; the lanthanides and actinides really should\nbe part of the table, but we separate them out, because it's hard to fit that on a piece of paper;\nreally, this is what it should look like. And really, it would be best if it wrapped\naround into a circle, so that fluorine, and neon, and sodium were all next to each other, instead of being on opposite sides of the map, because they're just one proton away! Mendeleev's contribution, nonetheless, is\nmore powerful than at first it seemed. He ended up forming a guide to help future\nchemists understand things that wouldn't be discovered for 25, 50, even 100 years. Indeed, after Mendeleev's theories were published\nand accepted, the overwhelming cry form the scientific community\nwas \"Why? Why? Why?\" And although Mendeleev was not himself concerned\nwith this stuff, he actually denied the existence of atoms, or indeed anything he couldn't see with his own eyes. It turned out that the answer to the first\n\"Why\", was the electron. That sneaky little electron; Mendeleev, if he'd been around to see their discovery, he would have hated them. But you, you will have a healthy respect for\nthem, after you learn all about them on the next\nepisode of Crash Course Chemistry. Thank you for watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry. If you were paying attention, you now know: The terrible, beautiful, and wonderful story\nof Dmitri Mendeleev; How he organized the elements into the periodic\ntable; Some of the basics of the relationships in\nthat table; Why Mendeleev stood out from his colleagues; and how the table as we know it today could\nstand some improvement.

        "transcription": "Hi. You‚Äôre on a rock, floating¬†\nin space. Have did we get here?¬† Well, about 4.5 billion years ago, the earth¬†\nwas big ball of flaming rocks, constantly¬†¬† bombarded by even more rocks from space. Fun¬†\nfact! Those rocks probably had some water¬†¬† inside them, which has now turned into steam.\nBreaking news! The earth is cooling down. Oh yeah,¬†¬† did I mention tha- [it‚Äôs raining.]\nWhoops, everything‚Äôs flooded, but hey,¬†¬† at least there‚Äôs some cool stuff at the bottom,¬†\nlike hydrothermal vents, which are piping hot¬†¬† and filled with a bunch of chemicals, that can¬†\nmake some very interesting stuff. Wait a minute,¬†¬† what the heck is going on here?\n[Biology]¬† Biology is the study of life, but really,¬†\nit‚Äôs just chemistry in disguise. I mean¬†¬† you and I are basically just a big ball¬†\nof molecules that can make funny sounds.¬† Carbohydrates give you quick energy, lipids store¬†\nlong term energy and make membranes, proteins make¬†¬† up tissues and nucleic acids make DNA. Also, to¬†\nmake all the chemical reactions possible, living¬†¬† beings, have inside of them a bunch of enzymes.\nThey‚Äôre special proteins that act as catalysts,¬†¬† which just means they help chemical reactions¬†\nspeed up by either breaking down or combining¬†¬† one specific thing. For example, lactase¬†\nbreaks down lactose, the sugar found in milk.¬† Ok, so enzymes make life possible¬†\nby speeding up chemical reactions,¬†¬† but what even is‚Ä¶life? Scientists don‚Äôt really¬†\nseem to agree, but obviously a cat is different¬†¬† from a rock. The cat can produce energy by¬†\nmetabolizing food, it can grow and develop,¬†¬† reproduce, and it responds to the¬†\nenvironment, whereas the rock does not.¬† Also, unlike rocks, every living thing on¬†\nearth is made of cells, of which there‚Äôs¬†¬† two main categories: Eukaryotes and prokaryotes.\nEukaryotes have fancy organelles which are bound¬†¬† by membranes, like the nucleus, inside of which is¬†\nDNA. Prokaryotes, have none of those organelles,¬†¬† and the DNA is just kind of chilling¬†\nthere, like freely floating around.¬† This is why Prokaryotes are just¬†\nsingle cell organisms like bacteria¬†¬† and archea whereas eukaryotes can form¬†\ncomplex organisms like protists, fungi,¬†¬† plants and animals. These are what‚Äôs known¬†\nas ‚Äúkingdoms‚Äù, which is a taxonomic rank,¬†¬† so basically, how we classify different living¬†\nthings and how they‚Äôre related to one another.¬† Because there are quite a few species of¬†\nlife on this planet, and naming them cat,¬†¬† dangerous cat and water cat wouldn‚Äôt really be¬†\nall that helpful, we also give every species¬†¬† a unique and unambiguous scientific name¬†\nconsisting of the genus and the species.¬† One thing every species has¬†\nin common is homeostasis, aka,¬†¬† keeping certain conditions in check, so ya don‚Äôt¬†\ndie. If you feel warm, your body will sweat,¬†¬† if you‚Äôre cold, your body will shiver.\nA cell does kind of the same thing just¬†¬† that it balances out concentrations of certain¬†\nchemicals. You see, enzymes for example, only¬†¬† work in a very specific environment, let‚Äôs say at¬†\nsome specific pH value. If this changes too much,¬†¬† the enzymes will denature and won‚Äôt work anymore.¬†\nTo counter this, the cell needs to constantly keep¬†¬† up this specific pH value, which is controlled¬†\nby the concentration of acid and base molecules.¬† Ok. But like, how does the cell do that?\nThe secret lies in the cell membrane. You see,¬†¬† it‚Äôs a semipermeable phospholipid bilayer,¬†\nokay that‚Äôs way too many words, all it is,¬†¬† is two layers of these funky looking molecules¬†\nwith a polar head and a nonpolar tail.¬† This allows small molecules like water¬†\nand oxygen to slip right through,¬†¬† whereas larger particles like ions need special¬†\nchannels that can be opened or closed, which¬†¬† gives the cell control of what goes in and out.\nNaturally, particles move with the gradient,¬†¬† so from a place of high concentration¬†\nto a place of low concentration. Or,¬†¬† in the case of water, it can also move to a place¬†\nof high solute concentration, so for example salt.¬† Welcome to Biology Pro Tips Season 1, tip¬†\nof the day: do not drink too much saltwater.¬†¬† There‚Äôs a bunch of salt in saltwater, in¬†\nfact, more salt than inside of a cell,¬†¬† which means it will draw water from your cells and¬†\ndehydrate you. Yeah that‚Äôs it have a great day.¬† The process of balancing out gradients is known¬†\nas ‚Äúdiffusion‚Äù and happens automatically, but,¬†¬† by using a little bit of energy, particles¬†\ncan actively be moved against the gradient.¬† The energy comes from Adenosine¬†\nTriphosphate or ATP. To be exact,¬†¬† the highly energetic chemical bonds between the¬†\nphosphate groups can be broken to obtain energy.¬† This is kind of important, as¬†\nin, every organism and every cell¬†¬† needs to make ATP for example, through cellular¬†\nrespiration which happens in the mitochondria:¬† Together with oxygen, glucose, so sugar, is¬†\nturned into water, carbon dioxide and ATP.¬† This is nice, but it only works if you already¬†\nhave glucose. Humans are ‚Äúheterotrophs‚Äù. They¬†¬† eat food, inside of which is sugar,¬†\nwhich is then broken down into glucose.¬† Plants on the other hand are ‚Äúautotrophs‚Äù.¬†\nSimply put, they said ‚Äúscrew food, I‚Äôll just¬†¬† make my own glucose by staring at the sun‚Äù. You¬†\nsee, plant cells have small organelles called¬†¬† ‚Äúchloroplasts‚Äù inside of which is chlorophyll,¬†\nwhich absorbs red and blue light but reflects¬†¬† green light, which is why most plants look green.\nThe absorbed energy from light is used to split¬†¬† water and make a special form of carbon dioxide¬†\nwhich can then be turned into glucose and oxygen.¬†¬† Okay quick recap, once you have glucose, either¬†\nfrom food or photosynthesis, you can do cellular¬†¬† respiration, to get energy in the form of ATP.\nChemically, ATP is what‚Äôs known as a nucleotide.¬†¬† It has a phosphate group, a five carbon sugar and¬†\na nitrogenous base. You know what else is made of¬†¬† nucleotides? Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.\nIt consists of two strands of nucleotides,¬†¬† with the sugar and phosphate groups, but the¬†\nactually important part is the nitrogenous base,¬†¬† which comes in four flavours: Adenine,¬†\nThymine, Cytosine and Guanine.¬† These bases can form base pairs through¬†\nhydrogen bonds, where Adenine goes with Thymine,¬†¬† and Cytosine goes with Guanine. These bonds¬†\nare what holds the two strands of DNA together.¬† Okay, but, how the heck does that store¬†\ngenetic information? I‚Äôm glad you ask!¬† A ‚Äúgene‚Äù is a section of this DNA¬†\nthat codes for a special trait,¬†¬† by carrying a certain sequence of base pairs,¬†\nwhich is like a recipe for making a protein.¬† Why proteins? Because they‚Äôre like really¬†\nimportant, they transport molecules,¬†¬† act as enzymes and determine the way you look.¬†\nFor example, the difference between brown and¬†¬† blue eyes is the amount of a pigment called¬†\n‚Äúmelanin‚Äù in the cells of the iris. The OCA2¬†¬† Gene codes for ‚ÄúP-Protein‚Äù which we believe¬†\ncontrols the amount of melanin in cells,¬†¬† meaning that the proteins made from this gene,¬†\ncould be what determines your eye colour.¬† Cool! There‚Äôs just one issue: Your DNA¬†\nand its information is in the nucleus,¬†¬† but proteins are made in organelles¬†\ncalled the ribosomes. How do we get the¬†¬† information from A to B? The answer is RNA.\nIt‚Äôs kind of like DNA, just that it‚Äôs most¬†¬† often a single strand, it uses a ribose instead of¬†\ndeoxyribose and instead of Thymine it uses Uracil,¬†¬† which makes it less stable, but that‚Äôs besides¬†\nthe point, here‚Äôs what RNA actually does:¬† Let‚Äôs say you want to make the protein¬†\ncoded for by this gene. An enzyme called¬†¬† ‚ÄúRNA polymerase‚Äù will split the DNA and make¬†\na strand of RNA with the complementary bases,¬†¬† essentially copying the information from the¬†\nDNA to the RNA. This is called ‚Äútranscription‚Äù.¬† The new strand is called messenger¬†\nRNA or mRNA, because it carries this¬†¬† message out of the nucleus to a ribosome.\nRemember how I said that a gene is like a¬†¬† recipe for a protein? Well, on the mRNA, which¬†\ncarries the same base sequence as that gene,¬†¬† every group of three bases, which is called¬†\na ‚Äúcodon‚Äù, codes for a specific amino acid,¬†¬† which are the building blocks for proteins.\nWelcome to Biology Pro Tips Season 1, if you want¬†¬† to decode a sequence of RNA, there is actually a¬†\nchart for that! Yeah that‚Äôs all have a great day.¬† These amino acids are carried by special¬†\nmolecules called transfer RNA or tRNA,¬†¬† which have a unique anticodon that can only¬†\nattach to its matching codon on the mRNA.¬† The job of the ribosome is to read over codons on¬†\nthe mRNA and attach the matching tRNA molecules,¬†¬† which then leave behind their amino acid. As the¬†\nribosome moves along the mRNA and attaches more¬†¬† tRNA, which happens a couple thousand times, the¬†\namino acids combine into a ‚Äúpolypeptide chain‚Äù,¬†¬† which is just a really long chain of¬†\namino acids, that can be bunched up,¬†¬† creased, smacked and folded into a protein.\nOkay, let‚Äôs recap: A gene is copied onto mRNA,¬†¬† which is then used to build proteins¬†\nby assembling a chain of amino acids.¬†¬† Aka transcription and translation.\nHey, this genetics stuff is pretty¬†¬† cool, can we learn more? Absolutely.\nOh yeah did I mention that you have, like,¬†¬† a bunch of DNA? You have about 20000 protein¬†\ncoding genes, each thousands to millions of¬†¬† bases long, and that only makes up around 1% of¬†\nyour entire DNA, the rest is just non-coding.¬† PLUS, almost every cell in your body contains your¬†\nentire genetic code, but genes can be turned on or¬†¬† off depending on the cell, which is good, because¬†\notherwise your brain cells might just start¬†¬† making stomach acid, which would not be good.\nFUN FACT! If you were to stretch out all the¬†¬† DNA of just one single cell, it¬†\nwould be about 2 meters long.¬† Wait a minute, how does that fit into a¬†\nmicroscopic cell? Well, if you were to look inside¬†¬† the nucleus, you wouldn‚Äôt find the DNA floating¬†\naround like this or even this, no, you would¬†¬† actually find lots of these worm looking things.\nTo be exact, DNA is coiled up around Proteins¬†¬† called ‚ÄúHistones‚Äù, which are then condensed into¬†\nstrands of Chromatin, which are then coiled up¬†¬† even more to make tightly packed units of DNA¬†\ncalled ‚ÄúChromosomes‚Äù, which kinda look like¬†¬† worms. Different sections on a chromosome carry¬†\ndifferent genes, and the entire human genome is¬†¬† split amongst 23 different chromosomes, although¬†\nevery body cell has 2 copies of every chromosome,¬†¬† one from the mother and one from the father.\nFor most chromosomes, the two copies are¬†¬† said to be homologous, meaning that they carry¬†\nthe same genes in the same location. However,¬†¬† the two versions of a gene can be different,¬†\nso the mother‚Äôs gene could code for brown eyes,¬†¬† while the father‚Äôs gene codes for blue eyes. These¬†\ndifferent versions of a gene are called ‚Äúalleles‚Äù.¬† For most of your genes, you have 2 alleles, one on¬†\neach chromosome from either parent. These alleles¬†¬† can be dominant or recessive, which determines¬†\nwhich of them is expressed. For example,¬†¬† brown eye color is a dominant trait, which¬†\nis shown by an uppercase B, whereas blue¬†¬† is recessive, which is shown by a lowercase b.\nAll this means, is that if you have the dominant¬†¬† brown allele, you will have brown eyes, no matter¬†\nwhat the second allele is. Only when there are¬†¬† two recessive alleles will it be expressed.\nWith this knowledge, we can predict the future!¬† Let‚Äôs look at how this trait is¬†\ninherited from parents to children:¬† Both of these parents have brown eyes, but¬†\nalso have a recessive blue allele in their¬†¬† genotype. Every child receives one allele¬†\nfrom each parent randomly, so these are the¬†¬† possible combinations for the children.\nMost combinations contain the dominant¬†¬† brown allele, so the child will have brown eyes.¬†\nBut, there is a small chance that a child gets¬†¬† two recessive alleles and has blue eyes, even¬†\nthough both parents had brown eyes! You see,¬†¬† it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the inside that counts.\nAlright, that‚Äôs cool, but reality is not always¬†¬† so simple. Some genes are not fully dominant, but¬†\nnot fully recessive either, which means that the¬†¬† phenotype, so the appearance, appears to mix.\nCrossing a red and a white snapdragon, where¬†¬† red is ‚Äúdominant‚Äù and white is ‚Äúrecessive‚Äù gives¬†\nyou a pink phenotype which is somewhere inbetween,¬†¬† aka intermediate inheritance. Or, crossing¬†\na brown and a white cow where both colours¬†¬† are dominant could give you spotted cow, so both¬†\nphenotypes are expressed equally, aka codominance.¬† Hey remember how I said almost all¬†\nchromosomes are homologous? Well,¬†¬† there‚Äôs one exception: the sex chromosomes.\nFemales have two big X chromosomes, whereas¬†¬† males have one X and one smaller Y chromosome.\nThese are partially homologous at the top,¬†¬† but since the Y chromosome is so small,¬†\nit‚Äôs missing genes that are present¬†¬† on the lower part of the X chromosome.¬†\nThese genes are called ‚ÄúX-linked genes‚Äù.¬† If one of these genes is a recessive trait like¬†\ncolour blindness, males are stuck with that trait,¬†¬† whereas females probably have another¬†\ndominant allele, to override it. This¬†¬† is why most colourblind people are male.\nNow, for genes to even be passed on,¬†¬† the body has to make new cells which can¬†\ninherit the genes. There‚Äôs two main mechanisms:¬† Mitosis, which is how the body makes identical¬†\ncopies of body cells to grow and repair tissues,¬†¬† and Meiosis, which is how the body¬†\nmakes gametes, so sperm and egg cells.¬† Mitosis starts with a diploid cell, so a cell with¬†\ntwo sets of chromosomes. These chromosomes consist¬†¬† of one chromatid, which has to be replicated¬†\nfor the new cell. After replication is when¬†¬† you see the familiar X shape consisting of¬†\ntwo identical sister chromatids. These are¬†¬† split into two identical diploid cells, with two¬†\nsets of chromosomes consisting of one chromatid.¬† Meiosis also starts with a diploid cell, but¬†\nafter replication, the chromosomes comingle¬†¬† and exchange genetic information in a process¬†\ncalled ‚Äúcrossing over‚Äù. The cell is then split¬†¬† into two non-identical haploid cells. These¬†\nhave one set of chromosomes, but they still¬†¬† consist of 2 sister chromatids. These cells split¬†\nagain into 4 genetically different haploid cells,¬†¬† where each chromosomes has one chromatid.\nMeiosis produces haploid cells, so that when two¬†¬† gametes combine into a fertilized egg or ‚Äúzygote‚Äù,¬†\nit again has the correct number of chromosomes.¬† This is cool, but, cell division is only a tiny¬†\npart of a cell‚Äôs entire life cycle. Most of its¬†¬† time is actually spent in interphase, aka just¬†\nchilling. All it does here, is grow and replicate¬†¬† all of its DNA, so that it actually has enough¬†\ngenetic material and size to divide in M-Phase.¬† There‚Äôs multiple checkpoints in the cell¬†\ncycle which are controlled by proteins¬†¬† like p53 or cyclin to check if the cell is¬†\nhealthy and ready to reproduce. If a cell¬†¬† is not quite right, it‚Äôs either fixed¬†\nor it destroys itself, which is called¬†¬† ‚Äúapoptosis‚Äù‚Ä¶or at least, that‚Äôs what it should do.\nNormal cells replicate until there‚Äôs no need to,¬†¬† but some cells just keep going. This is because¬†\nthey don‚Äôt respond correctly to these checkpoints¬†¬† and end up replicating out of control and¬†\nfunctioning wrong, which is also known as cancer.¬† This damaging behaviour is often a result of a¬†\ngene mutation, which is a change somewhere in the¬†¬† base sequence of a gene. This can happen during¬†\nDNA replication, when a single base is changed,¬†¬† left out or inserted into the original sequence.\nThis often changes the protein coded for by that¬†¬† gene and let‚Äôs just say that¬†\nchange is often not optimal.¬† Another type of mutation happens in chromosomes,¬†\nwhere entire sections of DNA could be duplicated,¬†¬† deleted, flipped around or transferred between¬†\nchromosomes. The most famous chromosomal mutation¬†¬† is probably when the 21st pair of chromosomes¬†\nhas an additional copy, so that there‚Äôs 3¬†¬† instead of 2. The result? Down syndrome.\nMutations might seem like a bad thing,¬†¬† but actually, they can also be neutral¬†\nor even beneficial. For example,¬†¬† a species of yellow grasshoppers might¬†\nmutate and become green, which makes them¬†¬† blend in with the grass and get eaten less.\nOver time, you can expect to see more and¬†¬† more green grasshoppers, as their fitness¬†\nhas increased. Not that kind of fitness,¬†¬† fitness as in, they can have more¬†\noffspring, because they get eaten less.¬† This is natural selection and the driving¬†\nfactor behind evolution, as the poorly adapted¬†¬† species gets selected against and the fittest¬†\nspecies, which has adapted to the environment,¬†¬† survives and and has the most offspring,¬†\npassing down the trait that made them survive.¬† If you think adaptation is cool, yes,¬†\nbut also it kind of sucks. You see,¬†¬† humans can get sick from bacteria or viruses,¬†\nbut nowadays, we have medicine that works. Good!¬† However, what if the bacteria mutates and¬†\nsuddenly, the medicine doesn‚Äôt work anymore? Well,¬†¬† that‚Äôs kind of exactly what is happening,¬†\naaand we have no clue how to fix it. So, yeah.¬† Oh yeah by the way, one thing many people confuse¬†\nis bacteria and viruses, and NO, they‚Äôre not the¬†¬† same. Bacteria are prokaryotes, so they consist¬†\nof a single cell which can reproduce on its own,¬†¬† and we treat bacterial infections such as¬†\nstrep throat and tetanus with antibiotics.¬† Viruses are not made of cells, in fact,¬†\nwe‚Äôre not even sure they‚Äôre alive. They¬†¬† share some signs of life, but they can only¬†\nreproduce inside a host, and they don‚Äôt grow,¬†¬† so it‚Äôs not really alive, but it‚Äôs not dead¬†\neither, it‚Äôs more of non-living kind of thing.¬†¬† Also, you cannot treat viral infections with¬†\nantibiotics, most of the time you just have to¬†¬† chill out and let your immune system do its thing.\nNow you might think bacteria are a bad thing, but¬†¬† actually, you have millions good bacteria inside¬†\nyour gut. The live in symbiosis with you, so you¬†¬† give them food, and they help you digest it.\nSpeaking of digestion, your body is made of¬†¬† many complex organ systems that work¬†\ntogether to make sure you don‚Äôt die,¬†¬† and I know what you‚Äôre thinking. Actually¬†\nI don‚Äôt, but I know how you‚Äôre thinking.¬† The nervous system, consisting of nerves,¬†\nwhich connect to the spinal cord and lead¬†¬† to your brain, is made of cells called¬†\n‚Äúneurons‚Äù which can conduct electricity¬†¬† along this long tube called the ‚Äúaxon‚Äù.\nAnything you see, think and feel, it‚Äôs¬†¬† all just electrical signals going to your brain,¬†\nand your brain telling your body how to respond.¬† To be exact, the signals are called ‚Äúaction¬†\npotentials‚Äù and happen at the same strength¬†¬† and the same speed every time, so¬†\nthe only difference between ‚Äúhey,¬†¬† I‚Äôm a little cold‚Äù and ‚ÄúOMG I AM ON FIRE‚Äù is¬†\nwhere it happens and how frequent the signals are.¬† When a neuron is just chilling, the axon is¬†\nmore negative on the inside than on the outside,¬†¬† because there‚Äôs an unbalanced amount ions. This¬†\ncauses an electric potential of about -70mV.¬† When there is a stimulus, signalling molecules¬†\ncalled neurotransmitters dock onto ion channels on¬†¬† the axon and open them, letting the ions flow and¬†\nchanging the electric potential around that area.¬† Now, action potentials are all or nothing.¬†\nA small stimulus won‚Äôt really do anything,¬†¬† but, if the potential exceeds about¬†\n-55 mV, boom, action potential.¬† Ion channels around the stimulus¬†\nopen and ions rush into the cell.¬† This causes the charge distribution in that¬†\nsection of the axon to reverse for a split second,¬†¬† which is called ‚Äúdepolarisation‚Äù.\nThe ion channels that are next to¬†¬† this area are influenced by this and open as well,¬†¬† which causes a chain reaction and sends¬†\nthe signal all the way down the axon.¬† Some neurons have a myelin sheath made¬†\nof Schwann cells, which insulate the¬†¬† axon and only leave tiny gaps called nodes of¬†\nranvier. If there‚Äôs a stimulus, the charges¬†¬† can ‚Äújump‚Äù across the nodes which transmits¬†\nthe signal way faster than a normal neuron.¬† But either way, at the bottom, the electric signal¬†\nreaches a terminal button, which connects the¬†¬† current neuron to the dendrites of the next. If¬†\nyou zoom in, you‚Äôd notice that the two cells don‚Äôt¬†¬† even touch, there is actually a small gap. This¬†\nis once again where neurotransmitters come in:¬† Once the button is depolarized, tiny packages¬†\nof neurotransmitters get released, and bind¬†¬† to receptors of following dendrite, either¬†\nblocking it from doing anything or causing¬†¬† another action potential, which repeats the cycle.\nHmmm.

        "transcription": "in many ways the octopus is as close to alien life as we may ever see few creatures in the world are as remarkable and bizarre a part of a class of animals called cephalopods they are among the most intelligent and most mobile of all the invertebrates they live in every ocean in the world in the deep sea in kelp forests in coral reefs along rocky shorelines and they are as diverse as the habitats they live in they can be massive or absolutely tiny some species are venomous and some are just downright strange in any given moment they can appear spiky or they can appear smooth they are so different from us that most of their 500 million neurons are not in their brain but in their arms which can smell and taste and even think and so intelligent that their cognitive ability matches that of many large brain vertebrates they have left scientists stunned about how a creature so far from us on the evolutionary tree could evolve such complex behaviors their intelligence emerging in an entirely novel and independent way from our own so how did the octopus become so biologically complicated an island of complexity in the sea of invertebrate animals just how intelligent are they and how can studying them reveal information about our own minds [Music] cephalopods have been around for a long time fossil records show that they evolved over 500 million years ago long before any fish reptiles or mammals ever appeared on earth the early ancestor of the octopus was quite small and had a shell which it used to protect itself as it crawled along the ocean bottom cephalopods are after all members of the mollusk phylum a group of creatures that are usually slow and simple with soft bodies and a hard protective shell like snails clams and oysters but around 140 million years ago the lineage that produced the octopus lost their shells making them nimble agile creatures but in the process also made them rather vulnerable survival of these soft-bodied creatures for so many millions of years therefore seems unlikely in a sea full of dangerous hungry predators but this vulnerability and selective pressure may be precisely what has allowed the octopus to become the remarkable creature we know today because an octopus has almost no hard parts at all except its beak it can squeeze through any hole as long as it's larger than its eyeball this allows the octopus to hide in very small crevices a certain evolutionary advantage when escaping large predators like sharks or dolphins but the soft-bodied octopus evolved an even more clever way of evading detection they are masters of disguise watching this clip of an octopus you can see just how quickly and drastically it can change colors in slow motion reverse you see the color change spread across its body the 3d texture of the skin also changes to match the surrounding seaweed and coral in the blink of an eye it has almost completely blended in with its surroundings cephalopod camouflage is among the most dynamic in the animal kingdom and relies on a system of extremely sophisticated tissues chromatophores are organs that are speckled across the skin of the octopus like freckles they contain tiny pigment-filled sacks like little balloons full of different colored dye which can be black red or yellow the pigment sacks are surrounded by radial muscles which can stretch the sac to reveal the pigment's color just like balloons full of dye when stretched their pigment color appears bright and vibrant depending on which sets of sacks an octopus opens or closes it can produce patterns such as bands stripes or spots helping to turn itself into a rock a coral or a kelp in an instant but if the octopus needs to produce colors outside of black red and yellow it uses another layer of reflective structures in their skin called erytophorse they are stacks of very thin cells that lay beneath the chromatophores they contain a protein called reflectin that bounces certain wavelengths of light back out they are responsible for the metallic blues and greens that appear to shimmer on the skin of the octopus beneath that layer is yet another layer of reflective tissue called lucifers these reflect ambient light usually producing white hues by combining reflection from the erytophores and lucifers with the correct patterning of the chromatophores the octopus can create a very convincing copy of its surroundings but the octopus has one more trick up its sleeve allowing it to disappear in plain sight almost completely using a structure called papillae it can change the texture of its skin creating ridges and bumps that rise and fall this helps the octopus match its surroundings even better with all these tools the shell-free soft-bodied octopus has been able to deceive an ocean full of predators for millions of years but their survival has not hinged on these camouflage properties alone it's the way they're controlled that is perhaps an even more compelling survival tool [Music] when an octopus travels along the sea floor they have to assess the background and modify their camouflage constantly they are making decisions at a rapid pace one researcher observed an octopus changing its camouflage 177 times in one hour octopuses camouflage reaction times are faster than any other animals up to 200 milliseconds as fast as the fastest blink you can do but despite doing so much with color the octopus and almost all cephalopods are surprisingly thought to be colorblind how can they match colors they can't even see in 2015 the answer to this question started to be uncovered researchers found that the skin of an octopus is sensitive to light due to photoreceptor genes active in the skin even when the skin was detached from the body it could respond to light and change the shape of its chromatophores scientists realize that an octopus can see with not just its eyes but also its skin but as the octopus body was evolving its color-changing defense mechanisms when it lost its shell 140 million years ago another transformation occurred the development of its large brain and nervous system the photoreceptor genes in the skin work in connection with the octopus's large and complex brain the octopus can change colors so fast because the octopus controls its chromatophores neurally other animals that can change color like chameleons for example take much longer because their color change is hormonally controlled hormones take time to get into the blood and distribute around the body a color change can take over 20 seconds when controlled this way some researchers believe that color change in the octopus may be like breathing or blinking for us something it can choose to do but also something that can happen involuntarily it can have awareness from its eyes and brain but also throughout its body the octopus nervous system is large like ours but built with a different relationship between body and brain altogether the common octopus has around half a billion neurons in its body for comparison humans have about a hundred billion most invertebrates usually have much less snails have only twenty thousand but cephalopods like the octopus score in the same range as many vertebrates like cats dogs and parrots more than any other invertebrate and of their 500 million neurons only a third are found in their brain the majority are found in their eight arms and as strange as it sounds this allows the octopus to in a way think with its arms for a long time scientists have known that a severed octopus arm can respond to stimuli an hour after being separated from the central brain but a paper last year began to reveal the extent of this autonomy using video modeling they observed the octopus as it explored objects in its tank and looked for food the program quantified movements of the arms tracking how the arms work together in synchrony suggesting direction from the brain or asynchronously suggesting independent decision making in each appendage and they found that in the flow of information from the environment to the octopus some information bypasses the central brain entirely the suckers in arms can in a way think for themselves allowing the octopus to analyze its environment extremely quickly and react with matching speed along with skin that can perceive and change color on its own the relationship between brain and body in the octopus is full of blurred lines and on top of this unusual neural layout and strange body autonomy cephalopods are smart extremely smart and this is really what gives the octopus its alien-like status they are so far from any other intelligent life on the tree of evolution but still compete with vertebrates in their raw cognitive ability evolution invented intelligent life not once but twice in two completely different ways in the evolutionary tree of life we sit upon the branch of mammals nearby are the fish reptiles birds and amphibians the other members of the larger classification of vertebrates this group is where we see all of the intelligent life we normally think of humans primates dogs cats dolphins and some birds when we collect these animals and trace back to our common ancestor it was likely a lizard-like animal that lived around 320 million years ago like us this animal would have had a backbone four limbs a head and a skeleton it would have walked around well adapted to land and had a well-developed central nervous system but to find where we split from the octopus we have to travel much further down the branches to around 600 million years ago the creature we find there is a simple flat worm it had an extremely basic nervous system and no inklings of what we would consider intelligence as the evolutionary tree branched and diverged intelligence blossomed on our branch of vertebrates and totally separately in the cephalopods and with the cephalopods evolving before any of the intelligent vertebrates it's likely that they were the first intelligent animals that appeared on earth but what actually is intelligence how can we identify or even measure such a thing in an animal so different from us in humans intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to think abstractly understand communicate problem solve learn form memories and plan actions this is usually measured by intelligence tests which can be given a numerical value but we can't give a standardized test to an octopus we can only observe their behaviors why the cephalopods well they're the most interesting mollusks in terms of behavior no question to learn more about the depth of octopus intelligence as researchers currently understand it i spoke with jennifer mather professor in the department of psychology at university of lethbridge and scientific advisor for the film my octopus teacher pretty well every learning task you give them they can do short-term long-term spatial memory object perception you know but it's more than learning they also go in for planning and planning is not so obvious and one of the famous examples is what that's been called the coconut carrying octopus so the octopus is going off to a place where there's no shelter and it takes these coconut halves with them and when it wants to stop and rest it picks them up and brings them up because it's like they're surrounded it's amazing some scientists argue that this behavior is a rare example of composite tool use a behavior previously thought to only exist in humans some primates and some birds and it may be evidence of complex intelligence for two reasons first this tool use might represent a behavioral innovation allowing octopuses to protect themselves in areas where they can't otherwise hide second because the coconut shells are transported with great effort to meet future needs this behavior might indicate an octopus's planning ability the octopus has to imagine the future and connect the dots between past events current actions and future events which is not a simple task octopuses also do well in memory tests and can differentiate between different people even when they're wearing the same outfit and in a study done by professor mather the common octopus has also been shown to be extremely playful i would describe them as extremely exploratory sort of like a five-year-old kid taking stuff apart going off and feeling around with the landscape just grabbing more information play is often defined as a behavior that is not necessary for survival done on purpose but seemingly for pleasure the action is often repeated exaggerated and carried out when the animal is adequately fed healthy and not under stress we figured that the animals were more likely to play if they were safe and bored so we set up octopuses in an aquarium with a place to hide and nothing else and then we got a pill bottle and put enough water in it that it floated at the surface also in the mix was a water intake pump for the aquarium that the researchers hadn't necessarily intended to be part of the experiment it created a current that pushed the pill bottle across the top of the tank which sparked the curiosity of some of the octopuses so we did this with six animals okay in two cases the pill bottle came across like this the octopus shot a jet of water at it which meant that it went back towards the water intake and it came back again if an octopus did this once or even twice it wouldn't be experimentally significant but a few carried out this behavior so many times that it couldn't be ignored one of them did this i think it was 14 times and one of them did it 21 times it was the marine equivalent of bouncing the ball in addition to helping establish motor coordination play in most species is largely needed for social purposes for establishing rank for learning social rules or for social bonding and due to its complexity play is considered to be almost exclusive to mammals with a few exceptions and other vertebrates like some birds but the octopus is a solitary creature it has no social bonds no social hierarchy it makes us rethink the evolutionary reasons for play in fact much of our idea of intelligence is based on the idea that it evolved out of a social need for decades scientists have wondered about the origins of intelligence and have tried to understand why certain animals evolved intelligence and others did not the social intelligence hypothesis is the often favored hypothesis for the evolution of complex cognition it's the idea that intelligence evolved due to the demands of group living such as maintaining complex and enduring social bonds deception cooperation or social learning when most of the animals we think of as smart humans primates dogs dolphins began living in groups there became a need for more complex behaviors and therefore a bigger more complex brain but this theory can't explain why intelligence evolved in cephalopods a different theory must exist for these non-social creatures you see our big problem with knowing the development of intelligence is that we know it from the mammals from the primates our relatives so we know that this particular set of conditions sets us up for being intelligent but then if we have another model the octopus then we have to say okay these conditions being part of a social group they're not necessary for intelligence perhaps the pressures of finding food and evading predation is enough for intelligence to blossom this is the basis for the ecological intelligence hypothesis which suggests that complex cognition evolved to meet the challenges associated with predation foraging and competitive pressures and when the octopus lost its shell 140 million years ago perhaps the pressure of predation was so high that outsmarting their attackers became the only way for it to survive these two theories are not competing ones but rather two explanations for two instances of intelligence on the tree of life the octopus gives us a rare chance to investigate an alternate intelligence an alien-like life-form here on earth where we once thought there was only one model for intelligence we now know there are at least two and who's to say how many more there could be on this earth or elsewhere but despite the distance from us on the evolutionary tree the octopus still lives inside the same grand experiment as we do the earth the oceans and the spinning wheels of evolution have crafted us both they are not so much alien then as much as a distant distant relative and by stepping aside from our human-centric view of intelligence can we start to clearly see the infinite possibilities of cognition the story of the modern octopus began so long ago back when there was no life yet on land but around this time 500 million years ago the oceans had begun to explode with life this period called the ordovician was known for its amazing diversity of invertebrates and of these invertebrates the massive armored cephalopods were king they dominated the seas for roughly 360 million years the fossil records show an amazing array of creatures during this time some we recognize and some we definitely don't life was thriving until something stopped nearly all of it in its tracks to learn more about this period on the early earth

at all and what's with those crazy morphological structures why are tardigrades thought to be invincible and could their incredible abilities one day allow them to colonize outer space and the harsh environment of [Music] Mars all tar R grades are aquatic animals requiring a film of water around their bodies to permit Locomotion and gas exchange however most of the tardigrades known to science are found on land in mosses and lyans all over terrestrial environments these tardigrades are known as limot terrestrial and are classified as UT tardigrades but you can't see them with the naked eye they are between 100 and 500 microns in length and only visible under a microscope but luckily for me it doesn't have to be a very powerful one so having recently moved to a very wet Mossy environment I'm going to see if I can find one so the scientists told me that uh you can find Charter grades in mosses and lyans so I'm going to collect some Moss from this rock that I just found um Betty's going to help me you helping um and I'm going to put it in this petri dish and later we'll try to decant some tardigrades out of it the origins of tardigrades appear to go back all the way to the Cambrian around 550 million years ago before land plants before the earliest ancestors of mammals before the dinosaurs basically tardigrades have been around for a long long time today scientists struggle to fit the tardigrade neatly into the evolutionary tree they're in their own film called tardigrada and there is still much debate about whether they're more closely related to arthropods or to nematodes PhD student Mark mapalo considers himself a Paleo gridlist and has special interest in studying ancient tardigrades the oldest fossil tardigrades that we are sure is a tardigrade is actually around the Cretaceous it's dated around the Cretaceous which is like you know the time of the dinosaurs basically so it's it's 90 million years old and all of those stardog grade fossils are actually preserved in Amber so our hypothesis that this the star degrees are so small that the only way for you to actually preserve them or the highest chance of them being preserved in a fossil is in Amber Amber is fossilized tree resin you're probably familiar with the sticky resin that comes out of some trees when their bark is injured now and in the past insects or tardigrades often get trapped in the substance and can't escape on occasion some of these ancient Globs of resin fell in water and ended up becoming buried in the sediment as it settled deeper and deeper into the Earth the pressure and temperature began to rise over Millennia these conditions caus the resin's compounds to polymerize where they turn hard and glassy whatever organisms were trapped inside the resin insects plants or tardigrades can be preserved with extraordinary Fidelity unfortunately the DNA of ancient tardigrades isn't preserved because DNA is fragile the very oldest traces of it we've ever found are only 2 Mill ion years old but much of tardigrade Anatomy is preserved in the Amber and even though the oldest tardigrade fossil is 90 million years old it still very much looks like a modern tardigrade you would see it and it's actually like still looked the same as living it's just like amazing how basically their external morphology did not really change that long and that's because the tardigrade body plan is remarkably effective at the head they have mouth-like organs equipped with piercing stylets they use these freaky little tongues to pierce the cell walls of Plants algae and fungus they esophagus then sucks the food in and the nutrients spread from their digestive tract to the rest of the body but some tardigrades eat more than just plants and fungus some are predators that consume entire living organisms such as rapers nematodes and even other tardigrades predatory tardigrades can even have a significant impact on the biodiversity of other micro animals around them scientists found that hungry tardigrades will eat up to 56 nematodes a day in certain conditions and this can be really beneficial to the soil quality if those nematodes are pests who parasitize plants also on the first body segment some species of tardigrade also have very basic eyes made of just a handful of visual cells that allow them to detect light but like with everything else with tardigrades we're not exactly sure that's the whole story recently scientists identified multiple R opsins in tardigrades that were associated with vision but these opsin didn't seem to help them with color vision as they might in other animals weirdly they weren't even really active in the adult tardigrades these opsin were most active when the tardigrades were still eggs what on Earth eggs need visual options for no one has any idea next on the tarr's body are the three trunk segments all of which have a pair of legs on either side and claws on those legs and the fifth and final segment of the body has a pair of legs that face backwards it's thought that the orientation of these legs helped the tardigrades grip onto things almost like a prehensile tail and the existence of all of these legs make tardigrades really strange microscopic animals the size of tardigrades rarely have legs and if they do they aren't used for walking water fleas for example have legs but they're used for swimming and sweeping food into their mouths rotifers of similar size swim or inchworm along their substrate and roundworms sort of just wiggle around walking in this microscopic domain is kind of unheard of one reason it might be so rare is because walking in water while being so small requires overcoming a ton of viscous forces it would be like walking through honey for us tardigrades also have to overcome an extremely variable environment moving through syrupy water climbing over piles of sediment or through clumps of tangly plant matter yet tardigrades used their eight stubby legs to walk through all of this with ease the world over does the smallest legged animal have some unique method of using their legs to overcome these obstacles to find out scientists looked at the Gate of tardigrades with specialized cameras they found that when tardigrades walk slowly they lift one foot at a time as they speed up they lift two feet that are diagonal from each other across the body keeping 4 feet on the ground and as they go even faster 3 ft are off the ground at once they keep a minimum of 3 ft on the ground at all times even at their fastest speeds not including the backward facing legs this differs from many fast vertebrate Gates like a horse's Gallop where all four feet come off the ground at once while the the tardigrade walking pattern may seem random to us it's actually not unique at all the scientists realized that despite having significant differences in size and skeletal structures this way of walking was very similar to insects like larger panarthropods such as stick insects insects about 500,000 times their size and separated by about 20 million years of evolution but what's the benefit of this type of walking for stick insects always keeping three or 4 ft on the ground provides them great stability over pointy Jagged and variable twigs and branches for tardigrades keeping 3 or 4 feet on the ground May similarly help provide stability as they trudge through variable complex terrain so tardigrades can't run fast like a horse or a micro horse I guess so they're slow but most importantly they're steady this similarity between tardigrade walking and insect walking was a surprising result and one that may point to the reason behind the existence of tardigrade legs in the first place it could be that arthropods and tardigrades share a common ancestor that had legs much like this nurly wired to walk with this pattern thus this could be a piece in the puzzle of tardigrade taxonomy putting them closer to arthropods than nematodes after all and further assisting tardigrades in their journey through thick and tangly environments are the claws at the end of their legs many tardigrades actually have complex double claws on each leg which consist of two slender primary branches and two basil secondary branches which themselves have two or three hooks these hooks help the tardigrade hold on to the substrate so they don't get carried away the difference in the number of Claws and their shape is an important way that scientists can distinguish between different species and there's something else fascinating about all the cells that make up those claws legs and body segments of tardigrade every cell that makes up every one of these body parts is a cell that the tardigrade has always had tardigrades don't grow by cell division like we do their growth occurs by enlargement of the individual cells rather than by cell division and adult tardigrades of the same species will all roughly have the same number of cells some with up to 40,000 this phenomenon is known as UTI it's possible that growth like this decreases the risk of cancer or other problematic mutations that arise during cell division with all of this incredible Anatomy combined tardigrades live basically everywhere in freshwater lakes rivers and ponds and on every single continent so if I were to get a microscope uh what do you think my chances would be if I went out into the world to look for grades where are you right now if you don't if you don't me am in Connecticut in New England okay yeah well I would say there's a high chance of you finding tardigrade there I feel like I always find the tardigrades in New England I don't see it's kind of tardigrade shaped oh there's something moving oh oh what was that but as much as I'm struggling to find a terrestrial tardigrade there's another type that's even harder to find the Marine tardigrades terrestrial tardigrades may be amazing but Marine tardigrades are like something out of a Dr Seuss hallucination Marine tardigrades are usually hetero tardigrades and they can be divided into three major ecological groups there's the species that live on the Slime of algae or the plates of barnacles and are sometimes known as ectoparasites there's the interstitial species which can be found in the top few centimeters of sand in the loral zone and and there are the deep sea benthic species Marine tardigrades are characterized by their calic sensory structures that are absent in ut tardigrades and many of these structures are downright flamboyant you know how when you look at a if you look in a stream and you look at macro invertebrates in a stream they're cool but then you look on a coral reef and it's like whoa mind-blowing tardigrades are like that terrestrial and freshwater tardigrades are cool you look at Marine ones and they're mind-blowing Dr Paul Bartels has been studying tardigrades since 2000 and more recently started focusing on Marine tardigrades and I can totally see the appeal some of these tardigrades are truly spectacular like tartis bubalis which was found in the Atlantic around the Pharaoh Islands it's got these posterior branches that come off the back end they branch and branch and branch and branch and then at each end there's these bubble like formations that can inflate or deflate and they can when they deflate they're like adhesive and when they inflate they can be buoyant and so it's this like Dr Seuss like character with these big balloons coming out the rear end and it's just crazy stuff like that and that's hardly the only oddl looking hetero tardigrade from the ocean some have adhesive claws some have wing-like structures that are extensions of the cuticle some have long inflatable Tails one of the ones I'm really interested in is there an intertial one that's called uh bpes bul codus bpes are these ones with little suction cup toes and they live in the mostly in intital Sands the suction cups allow them to hold on to Shifty intital beach sand but they vary there's about 40 species it's the most speos of all the Marine tardigrades and one thing that they clearly vary in from species to species is their coddle structures one of them that one of my students found near her home in the Outer Banks of North Carolina has this tail that is like it's like a flag pole at the end of the body it sticks up almost vertically from their rear and at the end of the tail there's this big membranous bubble like a balloon but what are these ridiculous structures for for some things scientists have a decent idea some of them are um kind of thick paddle-like structures and some of them more filamentous hairlike structures and we know that at least on some of the paddle shaped ones they have a pore at the end so presumably I think there's pretty good evidence that those are um chemosensory and the hairlike ones are probably tactile and for the crazy looking coddle structures like the flag pole for things like this there is less certainty one theory is that it helps them hold on tighter to their substrate like an anchor but the flag pole isn't mucusy and sticky like the feathers of tartis bubalis so it might not actually stick very good it could be that it gives them some buoyancy they don't Marine tter grades don't have any larval uh planktonic stage like almost all uh macroscopic marine animals do so they don't have an obvious way to disperse and yet in some cases we know they have pretty broad ranges and so maybe they're dispersing passively they don't swim no tardra swim they're all benic and living on the bottom but surely they get stirred up in the sediment and swept away with currents and so if you can stay up in the water column longer you're going to disperse further so maybe they have that has something to do with that I my my dream there is to figure out how to cut off the tails of the of the bulock codus with the flag pole and then drop them and measure how fast they drop wouldn't that be a cool experiment but experiments like this come with a challenge for as hard as terrestrial tardigrades are to find that's even more so the case with Marine tardigrades what about the Marine ones are so much harder to study or harder to find yeah you got to have quite a bit of patience they can be really rare they're much smaller in size than um terrestrial ones and you got to use a trick or two to isolate them from the sediment um namely something called the freshwater shock technique which is where you take a bucket of sand you pour a bunch of fresh water on it and they go into osmotic shock and release their grip on the sediments and it stuns them and then you can decant them through CVS and if you're studying the deeper living tardigrades it's even harder you have to scuba diive or have some other deep water collecting technique for this reason the vast majority of studies look at intertial Marine tardigrades there's probably less than 10 of us in the world that are actively studying Marine tarder grades and so every place I've gone to do inventory type work on Marine grades we always find new species in fact they kind of get in the way it takes so much work you know to to do some sort of ecological question that you're interested in it you end up discovering all these new species that have to be figured out today there are more than a thousand species of tardigrades that scientists have discovered and based on where we have and have not looked for tardigrades scientists believe that there are many many more to still be found so I'm from the Philippines basically I collected some mosses in the back of our building and started culturing this stard grades that I have and was able to create some monospecific cultures and and yeah and it turns out that species was like a new species so how many species do you think are still out there to be found is it in the tens or hundreds or thousands oh definitely I would I would I want to say at least a thousand thousands of new species out there and I can't even find one individual uh it's got a little swimy guy guys but that's not a tter grade oh wait what's this oh it's cool uh not as hard a grade oh oh oh we've got movement Oh I thought I was just going to be a worm but then look oh my God you can totally see his little fies my first tardigrade tardigrades are often referred to as Invincible which is of course not completely true in their natural environment they're pretty likely to get eaten or injured or die of old age but there is a reason they have this reputation in 1950 scientists demonstrated that certain tardigrades survived after exposure to -273 3¬∞ C close to absolute zero later experiments showed that these same species can survive briefly being heated to 150¬∞ C they can also survive being almost completely dehydrated how can this squishy little animal do any of this and what's the point why does a tiny little aquatic animal need to survive such extreme temperatures the overarching method for living through dramatic environmental changes es is called cryptobiosis this is when the tardigrades go into what's called a ton State a sort of suspended animation to do this they shut their metabolism completely down to the point where they're very almost dead the fibers in their muscles lock into place a bit like rigor mortise and often they lose an incredible amount of water from their body up to 98% in some cases when there's not enough water or when it's too hot a tier grade will fully contract into this ton State and freezing temperatures trigger a slightly different ton State called cryo biosis here the tardigrades use ice nucleating proteins outside of their cells to draw water out of them to prevent ice crystals from damaging them also aiding in this miraculous transition are a unique group of proteins called cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble proteins when the tardigrade undergoes stress like loss of water these proteins are produced and then condensed to form a network of filaments these create a gel-like substance that encases cells and provides them with structural Integrity without the pressure of water inside the cell the cells would collapse in on themselves in these realtime videos you can see the gel stiffen to provide a structure that keeps the cells from collapsing when conditions return to normal the proteins are no longer produced and the gel breaks down the  gr takes in water again and can wake up and in this ton State the shriveled nugget slows its metabolism to as little as 0.01% of its normal rate and even more impressive is that they can survive this state for decades researchers who collected Frozen Moss from Antarctica in 1983 stored the samples at -20¬∞ C for more than 30 years then the sample was thawed and two tardigrade were extracted from the sample named Sleeping Beauty 1 and 2 they were given algae for food and closely monitored unfortunately Sleeping Beauty 2 woke up but died on day 20 but Sleeping Beauty 1 woke up after 9 days and it started crawling around the petri dish it didn't eat until day 13 but by day 23 it was actually laying eggs and continued to do so four more times given these results it's clear that the recovery process is not easy and that not all tardigrades survive they are not extremophiles like the bacteria that grow near hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean and only some species of tardigrades can do this therefore tardigrades are considered extremo tolerant they can survive these states by going dormant but that's not where they Thrive tardigrades are often called the most Invincible animal but they don't even hold the record for the creature that can survive the longest in a suspended State just in the last couple years there's been a couple papers come out that kind of make tardigrades look like nothing you know right now the only tardigrades that we know for sure the the length of time that they've survived in cryptobiosis is a matter of like 30 40 years maybe 50 in one study there were just two papers for rotifers there's a paper on rotifers and a paper on nimod that came out over the last couple years that were um looking at Siberian permafrost ice core samples that were dated to 26,000 years and 43,000 years ago and they found nematodes and rapers in those two ice cores and when they brought them back to to room temperature in water they came out of cryptobiosis successfully Tarter grades don't even come close to those numbers as far as we know it's likely we just haven't found the evidence yet I believe it's only a matter of time before tardigrades are found um in those samples as well because we know biochemically they have at least as many tricks as the nematodes and the rivers have but why did tardigrades evolve to survive such extremes at all surviving absolute zero seems like Overkill it's likely because the tardigrade didn't evolve specifically for these scenarios but those are rather a nice side benefit that comes from what the tardigrade did evolve for scientists think that tardigrades evolved their extreme response to extreme environmental changes in the seas and oceans of the very ancient world the ability to go into the ton state may have first appeared as a response not to dry places or super cold places or super hot places but to changes in salt level in the sea if they lived in the intertial area when the water around these ancient tardigrades increased in salt concentration the water inside the creatures would have been pulled out through their permeable cells by osmosis where water flows from low to high concentrated environments the tardigrades would need some way to manage the way these changes in salinity dehydrated them the survival strategy they came up with is a ton state known as osmo biosis and this ability to survive overly salty conditions also became a way to survive completely dry conditions and as tardigrade started to populate sometimes temporary puddles and streams this became crucial and this dehydrated nugget State also conferred some resistance to the cold and to the hot allowing them to spread all over the world and often their hardiness allows them to be the first ones in new environments scientists sometimes refer to tardigrades as a pioneer species which means they are often the first species in a harsh environment whether that's the cooled and hardened lava Fields after a volcanic eruption or the toxic degraded soils that result from coal mining the tardigrades start eating and mating and becoming prey for other micro animals all that behavior sets the stage for an ever increasing number of creatures to enter that environment so pioneering Tendencies incredible ability to survive almost anywhere for scientists these things lead to the next big question can tardigrades survive space or even one day colonize new planets space hypothetically is the final environment to colonize one that almost no organism can withstand due to its vacuum and intense radiation but tardigrades are not most organisms so in 2007 scientists did the natural thing and yeed them up there the tardigrades hitch deride on the European space agency's Photon M3 Mission an unmanned mission that carried 40 different experiments into low earth orbit for 12 days including 3,000 tardigrades from two species they went up in their dehydrated chicken nugget State and were exposed to space vacuum in both UVA and UVB radiation the sun emits UVA UVB and UVC radiation on Earth UVC rays are almost completely absorbed by the atmosphere which is a good thing because they're the most dangerous about 90 5% of UVB is absorbed by the ozone layer but there's still enough getting to the surface to cause sunburns UVA is the least dangerous but still slightly increases the risk of skin cancer for the experiments researchers exposed some tardigrades just to the vacuum of space and others were exposed to the vacuum of space along with UVA and UVB radiation and some were exposed to all types of radiation the tardigrade exposed to just the vacuum of space did great those exposed to all types of radiation all died but some exposed to UVA and B did survive the tardigrades that survived these conditions represented the first animals ever to survive the combined exposure of vacuum Cosmic radiation and UV radiation in outer space and it's largely thanks to their damaged suppressor or dup genes the these genes code for a protein that can form a bubble wrap around their DNA ongoing studies suggests that by binding to DNA in the nucleus of cells dup acts as a physical Shield preventing radiation waves hitting the DNA it's the type of thing that makes scientists think those genes could be applied as protective therapy to other animals even one day us scientists have even inserted the duub gene into human cells using a virus as as a carrier they then fired X-rays at these human cells they found that DNA in the edited cells was 40% less damaged than those without the inserted Gene it's a long way from practical use but a tantalizing look at how these genes might be used to protect astronauts going into space while mutant human tardigrade astronauts are a long way from being engineered experiments tardigrade survival in space might also open up Avenues to space colonization Mars has long been eyed up as a potential second home for humans but it's cold unprotected from radiation and very very dry all things a Tarter grade can manage pretty easily we already know that moss and lyen who are also pioneer species like tardigrades can survive in very harsh environments researchers are investigating whether Genetically Enhanced versions of moss could grow in even harsher envir environments and still be good habitats and food sources for tardigrades if that were the case these could be a starter pack for bringing life to new planets like Mars this is all theoretical for now and there remains one vital element missing that even tardigrades can't live without and that's water on Mars the little water that exists is trapped in ice or minerals in the surface of the planet but this wasn't always the case Mars used to be covered in expansive oceans and just a few days ago the perseverance Rover made a huge Discovery the robot came across a viny rock on July 18th that could change the course of science Forever The Rock has evidence that water once ran through it and the Rover detected carbon-based molecules within the rock along with evidence that life sustaining chemical reactions may have occurred and most excitingly the rock is covered with what looks like leopard spots on Earth leopard spots like this in rocks are often a sign of fossilized microbes while we won't know for sure until the rock makes it back to Earth to be studied if evidence of microbes is found it's painfully exciting to wonder what those microbes would have been like would they have been similar to life on our planet similar to tardigrades or nematodes or bacteria as we know it when the story broke I knew immediately that this would be the kind of story to get sensationalized and that many news articles were going to get the facts straight up wrong so to help me Wade through the headlines and find the best sources I opened up ground news the website and app designed to help you pull back the curtain on media bias and factuality on ground news every story comes with a visual breakdown of the political bias reliability and ownership all backed by ratings from from three Independent News monitoring organizations and instantly I could see that yep the headlines were all over the place with some headlines claiming NASA scientists discovered actual life on Mars and others being misleading at best so I really appreciated the ground news headline summary of the story that said no NASA hasn't found life on Mars yet but the latest Discovery is intriguing so then knowing that I was about to head into a field of misinformation I wanted to select articles to read that would stay true to the science with ground news you can quickly scan the headlines and see which articles are flagged as having low high or mixed factuality so when I'm needing to do research on a subject I can easily filter out the ones with mixed or low factuality giving me the most factual information on a given news story on top of this when writing these videos I need to be aware of the bias in the reporting if only the left or only the right is reporting on a story that's a pretty big red flag and is something I need to look into before I repeat that information myself for this NASA and Mars story I could see that 43% of the sources lean left 29% lean right and 29% lean Center while this isn't a huge bias it is there and this information allows me to pause and make sure there is no ulterior political motive behind the stories I'm reading sometimes the bias is much worse and ground news helps illuminate blind spots with their aptly named blind spot feed another major science story right now is that the Earth just broke the record for its hottest day 2 days in a row and ground news shows that this story is a major blind spot for the right with only 11% of sources on this story leaning right I particularly like browsing the blind spot feed which highlights stories that are disproportionately covered by one side of the political Spectrum it helps me to understand the motives and intentions of media outlets and makes me feel like I'm circumventing the wool that so many media Outlets are trying to pull over everyone's eyes ground news provides all the tools you need to be a critical thinker and at this particular

        "transcription": "hello everyone and welcome to this year's last minute crash review for your end of course biology exam this video is for students who are about to take a final course test EOC or state exam in biology that means you might be in 9th or 10th grade right now but that may vary depending on your school or state in this video I'm going to quickly review some really important content that's commonly questioned on the end of course biology exams and review some basic skills that might pop up on your test remember this is a fast review so it won't cover everything you learned in biology and I do talk fast so feel free to change the speed on your video player if you need if you need to go back and do a deeper dive on any of these topics make sure to check out the other resources on my channel let's get started very briefly remember all matter on earth is made of different elements elements are composed of different atoms and in biology we really want to focus on molecules called organic compounds now these are special molecules that all contain carbon that are essential for life and the forming categories are nucleic acids proteins carbohydrates and lipids so we look at what they're made of the monomers or the basic units of nucleic acids are nucleotides the basic monomers of proteins are amino acids and carbohydrates the monomers are monosaccharide and the basic monomers of lipids are often fatty acids and glycerol now up here I have the basic structure as well this is actually a phospholipid which makes up the cell membrane of all living things and we'll get to that in a little bit now to remember all of these organic compound groups I like the pneumonic clean later party now for carbohydrates lipids proteins and nucleic acid acids one thing I like to add to this is clean later party especially now to remember that enzymes for that e are a type of protein which is really important enzymes are really important biological macro molecules and they belong in the protein category now let's talk about water really quick water is the universal solvent it is polar that means it's partially positive and partially negative on opposite ends so some molecules are water loving we call these hydrophilic and they interact easily they're soluble with water hydrophobic or water fearing molecules like oils and fats are insoluble in water now water has special properties it has cohesion meaning water is attracted to itself adhesion is the attraction of water molecules to other molecules or other things thinking adding something on capillary action is when cohesion and adhesion work together pulling up against gravity we can see this in stems in plants or in a straw even and water also has a high surface tension meaning it's more attracted to itself then the air around it which allows certain bugs like Strider bugs and leaves to float on the surface of water now let's get microscopic and go down to the cell remember cells are the basic units of life so all living things have cells all cells are surrounded by a cell membrane which is a phospholipid bilayer we talked about lipids all living things contain genetic information DNA and all cells have cytoplasm now if we look just at the cell membrane let's zoom in really closely it is actually a layer of two rows of phos phospholipids so are Bayer uh the heads of these fosol lipids are hydrophilic so they are able to interact with water easily the inner parts the Tails here they're ranging themselves away from the water because they are hydrophobic now there's two main types of cells we have eukaryotic cells which have a nucleus and membranebound organel like the mitochondria and then we have procaryotic cells which also are surrounded by membrane and also have DNA but they do not have a nucleus and they do not have membrane bound organel they do have ribosomes they do have a cytoplasm but we notice here the DNA which is the scribbles on the diagram is just floating freely in the cytoplasm unlike the DNA and eukaryotic organisms which is in the nucleus now eukaryotic organisms can be animals they can be plants and procaryotic organisms are mostly bacteria we have archa as well within our eukariotic cells we have different types for example animal cells over here which have a cell membrane and plant cells which are also surrounded by a cell wall for extra protection and support another key difference between plant and animal cells is the presence of a chloroplast which is shown right here chloroplasts are the location of photosynthesis which plants perform animal cells do not plant cells also have one rather large vacu and animal cells also have a vacu but um it's not as big and they may have several different vacul as well and remember both plant and animal cells plant and animal cells are both eukaryotic now let's zoom in once again on that cell membrane remember it is made made of a phospholipid Bayer now different molecules can get in and out of the cell membrane in different ways we have simple diffusion which is the movement of particles from a higher concentration to a lower concentration we have facilitated diffusion which allows particles to move from a higher concentration to a lower concentration but across a membrane facilitated being helped this protein channel is helping the molecules get through the membrane then we have active transport which allows molecules to move from a low concentration to a higher con concentration with the help of energy in the form of ATP so a way I like to remember this is kids going down the slide so simple diffusion requires no energy it's just a kid going down the slide from high to low by themselves facilitated diffusion might have a parent or a friend which is representative of our protein and they're going from high to low as well still requiring no energy themselves and then active transport think of a child going from low to high going up the slide so against the concentration gradient but they have to use energy to do that so they're using ATP all right when water moves across a membrane this is called osmosis this is water moving from a higher concentration of water particles to a lower concentration of water and when we think about where the water is moving and comparison to the solute or the other particles dissolved in the water solution here we have kind of an equal balance of particles in and out of the cell that are not water so we would call this an isotonic solution and water would move freely in both directions and about the same amounts in this situation we have a higher concentration of particles or solute inside the cell but a higher concentration of water particles which is the blue here outside of the cell so where would the water move the water would move into the cell this is a situation called a hypotonic solution where there are fewer solute particles outside the cell more inside the cell more water outside the cell a lower concentration of water inside the cell so water would move in and now here we have more solute particles out outside the cell or a higher concentration of solute particles so remember where is water going to move from a high concentration of water so that means it would move outside the cell this is called a hypertonic environment now in a hypertonic environment there is a chance that if a lot of water moves out of the cell the cell could actually shrink and the opposite would happen in a hypotonic environment a lot of water may move into the cell causing it to swell or burst let's get back to enzymes remember these are a type of proteins they are extremely important to living things they are biological catalysts meaning they get things going they get reactions started things like ligase helicase polymerase amase these are all enzymes notice all of these words and in the letters as e which makes it easy to recognize an enzyme even if you've never seen it before some things that can affect enzymes are temperature or pH if enzymes get too hot they can denature or unfold and then they'd be unable to act with their substrate because they no longer have the shape of the active site which is where a protein or an enzyme usually interacts with the substrate the molecule that it's going to do something to or interact with all right let's jump over to cellular respiration now all living things need energy and one of the main ways they get that is through cellular respiration which occurs in the mitochondria this is the process where organisms take glucose sugar and oxygen and go through reactions to transform it into ATP energy in that process carbon dioxide and water are also generated so if we think about this on a larger scale when we eat we consume glucose when we inhale we take in oxygen and when we exhale that CO2 is a byproduct of cellular respiration we exhale water vapor as well you can see that coming out of your mouth on a cold day and then ATP is also generated which gives us the energy to perform our daily activities and survive all eukaryotic organisms are going to perform some type of respiration another important reaction we need to be aware of is photosynthesis this is how plants get the food they need and they use sunlight energy to convert the carbon and carbon dioxide into food molecules like glucose so carbon dioxide in the sunlight energy and water can be transformed into glucose and oxygen remember the plants need that glucose and oxygen to perform cellular respiration themselves so these processes are complimentary and they feed each other which is why photosynthesis is crucial to life on Earth another type of respiration is fermentation this is often called anerobic respiration it's a type of anerobic respiration but that means it occurs without oxygen so bacteria some yeast perform this process and fermentation is not as efficient as cellular respiration cellular respiration produces 36 molecules of ATP where fermentation only produces two molecules of ATP so even though we can also perform fermentation in our muscle cells for example when we run out of oxygen cellular respiration is a much more efficient efficient process for producing energy molecules so like I said the type of fermentation that we can do in our muscle cells is called lactic acid ferment ation and that's because we take glucose and we generate energy molecules ATP but also lactic acid as a byproduct now yeast can do another type of fermentation called alcoholic fermentation and here the yeast produce ethanol as a byproduct or a type of alcohol and carbon dioxide so that carbon dioxide we can see as bubbles forming if you've ever done an experiment with yeast and fermentation it's why Bakers use yeast in their baking because that carbon dioxide can help bread rise and then also of course ATP is generated in this process let's get down to the DNA in our cells remember all living things contain DNA now DNA is organized it is wound up into chromosomes and condenses into chromosomal form before the cell can divide remember each double-sided chromosome that looks like this actually is a duplicated set of DNA so we have two sister chromatids here they're connected at the center by a centrr but usually within the cell if the cell is not preparing for cell division it may not be condensed into these chromosome forms it may may just be in chromatin form which sounds similar to chromosome but it kind of is represented as this like spaghetti like drawing where the DNA is Unwound it's not condensed as the cell prepares for cell division we may see the chromosomes begin to look like this that means the DNA has already been duplicated and the chromosomes are arranging themselves so they can prepare for cell division mitosis is a type of asexual reproduction where cells make exact copies of themselves one cell can generate two identical daughter cells you might have learned the phases of mitosis as Pat which stands for prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase and then at the end there's cyto Kinesis where the cytoplasm actually divides now in prophase the nuclear envelope dissolves and the chromosomes condense they start to move to the middle of the cell and metaphase they align along that cellular equator or the center of the cell and these spindle fibers on opposite ends of the cell come and attach the cir in anaphase think a for away the cytochrom are separated they start to get pulled away from each other towards opposite ends of the cell in telophase new nuclear envelopes start to form the cell starts to separate and inside a Kinesis we have the exact separation of the cytoplasm now with mitosis you've probably also studied meiosis which is a different type of cell division mitosis remember will copy body cells make exact duplicates of cells so one parent cell will create two identical daughter cells whereas meiosis is the process used to generate sex cells so one parent cell that goes through meiosis will generate four daughter cells but they'll only have half the genetic information as the parent cell so meiosis takes a little bit longer it goes through pmac twice and you don't need to memorize what happens in every single stage but the results are important so at the end of meiosis there are going to be four daughter cells each with half the genetic information as the parent cell and this genetic information has been mixed up a little bit so it's a different combination in each cell so the genetic information is different at the end of meiosis which is going to be helpful in the diversity of life on Earth as organisms reproduce sexually now as organisms reproduce we pass on our genetic traits Gregor Mandel was often called the father of genetics he did studies that recognize that a lot of traits are controlled by two different alals or versions of a gene and alals can be dominant or recessive meaning one can cover up a particular trait so we have these words heterozygous homozygous to talk about genotypes or combinations of genes so for example this big T Big T would be a homozygous dominant genotype and each of these letters represents a version of that Gene so you could pause and try to fill this in for yourself but here we go we have big T Big T would be homozygous dominant Big B little B would be heterozygous because it's two different versions of the same gene and Little T Little T is homozygous recessive two different versions of the recessive gene remember a big T often represents a dominant Al and a little or a lowercase letter would represent a recessive Al so for example if yellow body color is dominant to Blue in these fish if we have a Big Y and a little y that would result in a fish being yellow that's the phenotype so if we write the phenotypes here we would see what would happen with each of these genotypes remember genotypes are the combination of genes phenotypes are the actual physical character istics that we get from the genotype so you can pause this and go through each of the examples if you want and you might have also practiced punet squares in biology where you have to separate the alals of both parents on this table and figure out the possible combinations that could result from this Cross or from when these parents mate what their offspring could potentially have and remember what happens in a punet square is just a probability it is a potential outcome we won't know for sure until the off spring are born what the actual genotypes and phenotypes are and remember most human traits most genetics are very complicated so it's not as simple as Gregor mandelle said there's different types of dominance like incomplete dominance where there's a blending of traits co-dominance where we see representations of both traits so for example if a purple and a pink flower were co-dominant for flower color we might see both purple and pink petals in their flowers and of course there's also sex linked traits which are traits that are carried on the ex and the Y chromosomes now humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes that 23rd pair is going to be the sex chromosomes and females have two X chromosomes males have an X and A Y we talk about traits like color blindness these are traits that are carried on the chromosomes that are sex chromosomes so when we perform genetic crosses with sex linked traits we'll also write the X and the Y there and the alil as an exponent and make sure we carry all of the letters together in our punet Square cross process now genes can also be influenced by the environment for example these hydrangeas can have different colors based on the pH of the soil and this can go for a lot of different traits sometimes there's temperature differences that can change the color of fur of different mammals and of course chromosomes can have problems separating during meiosis or mitosis and when we have that non-disjunction or those sister chromatids not going to the opposite end of the cell correctly we could end up with a cell with different numbers of chromosomes for example triom 21 would mean that we have three copies of the 21st chromosome and triom 21 is also known as Down syndrome and that mean that person would have a condition that affects their physical characteristics some of their development because of that extra copy of that chromosome now let's talk about DNA a little bit closer now remember that in DNA we have four different bases A's T's G's and C's a is always pair with t g is always pair with C DNA replicates during the S phase of the cell cycle and in DNA replication we have the DNA strand separating and new strands of DNA are built off the templat so it's called semiconservative replication each new strand of DNA has half the old Strand and half brand new if we look back at our organic compound structure each nucleotide has a phosphate a sugar and a base atg or C and so when we put these together A's and T's we can see always pair together with these are little hydrogen bonds in the middle G's and C's always pair together and the backbone of the DNA molecule is made of phosphate and sugar molecules so how do we get exactly from our DNA to our actual trait well the process is called protein synthesis and in the nucleus where the DNA is the DNA will separate and then an mRNA sequence will be built off of the DNA template that mRNA will leave the nucleus and that process is transcription then we'll go through translation where the MRNA will go to a ribosome and tRNA molecules a different type of RNA will match up with the codons or the different groups of mRNA and bring over a matching amino acid and then those amino acids will start to link up and remember amino acids make proteins and so that is how we deliver the message to build the protein that is going to give us some trait in our bodies like the protein that influences eye color or the protein that gives us our hair shape so some differences to remember between DNA and RNA DNA is double stranded RNA is single stranded DNA has actually a deoxy ribo sugar that's where its name comes from deoxy ribonucleic Acid where RNA is made of a ribo sugar and then DNA's bases are A's T's G's and C's where RNA actually has a u instead of a t so if you're creating an RNA strand based off DNA remember to replace wherever a t would go with a u let's do a little practice so if we're transcribing a sequence of DNA this purple is the DNA here the sequence is a g t g t c the complimentary RNA would be a pairs with u g pairs with C T pairs with a G pairs with C T pairs with A and C pairs with G so again try this on your own go ahead and pause real quick the correct mRNA sequence here would be a ug CG auu and then don't forget the next step is translation where we build that protein and to do this by hand you might see a codon chart where you're asked to find the codon and then the matching amino acids so let's say we were looking at a codon that was CCC so we'd start in the center find the C then find the next C in the next Circle and then go to the final Circle here find that c that refers to Pro which is short for Proline one of our amino acids you do not need to memorize all your amino acids and if you're ever asked to do translation on a biology exam you will be provided with a codeon chart codeon charts can also look like this so let's look at CCC again C is our first base here we would go to the top for our second base here's another C and then find that third base C that also corresponds to Proline on this chart it is a universal genetic code let's talk really quickly about biotechnology now there's lots of different growing and emerging new technologies in the field of biotechnology from lab grown meat to DNA tests to genetically engineered organisms to resurrecting woly man Mammoth to crisper DNA and so of course there's ethical questions that go along with all these new techniques one technique you might see on your exam would be gel electropheresis which is a way to identify different parts of DNA so gel electropheresis can be used to study evolutionary relationships identify DNA found at crime scenes or maternity or paternity testing so here we have a simple gel in the gel DNA is loaded at these Wells at the top DNA is negatively charged so it'll be attracted towards the positive and then these DNA samples will travel down this gel as we run an electric current through the gel and we can see which pairs match up so here we have a mother which matches with child a and child B child C though does not have any matches with the mother so we can say that child C is not related to this particular mother and on a much larger scale remember that evolution is the change in genetic makeup of a population over time natural selection is the major mechanism behind Evolution and when we talk about an organism Being evolutionarily Fit that means means how well they are able to survive and reproduce not how strong they are not how fast they are it's really about how they can survive and pass on their traits to their offspring and remember that environments are a huge factor in evolution and they can act as a selective pressure and different organisms will have better rates of survival in different types of environments an adaptation is an inherited trait that is favorable to an organism that helps an organism survive and Charles Darwin was one of our main scientists that created this idea of natural selection we have lots of evidence now to support this idea of evolution from the fossil record to biochemical and DNA evidence embryology we can see how different organisms develop very similarly through the study of their embryos a philogenetic tree or a cladogram is a way to look at different evolutionary relationships over time and when we see branches on a tree we can see where their last common ancestor might have been and we can also add traits to this tree so if we look at a tree like this we can read it as anytime there's a trait that appears any organism that comes after that trait developed that trait so for example the organisms on this tree that have vascular tissue are ferns pine trees and flowering plants but not mosses and the organisms or the groups of organisms that have seeds are pine trees and flowering plants but not Ferns and mosses now backing all the way up to the biosphere remember different levels of organization in biology go from molecule all the way up to all life on Earth and at the population community and ecosystem level we can talk about biodiversity which is a measure of the variety of different types of organisms in an ecosystem and biodiversity is very important to living things because the more biodiverse an ecosystem is the more resilient it will be now of course environments are always changing large scale changes that can influence ecosystem can be maybe the addition of different nutrients to a system we could have forest fires we could have droughts we could have floods earthquakes there's so many things that could influence and create major changes to an ecosystem in a food chain we can see that organisms that produce their food often come first so producers like these autot tropes or grass are here and we always drew the arrow pointing towards the organism that is doing the eating so think about this food going into this Elk's stomach that's the direction of arrows for a food chain or a food web now we have our producers or our autotrophs here are heterotrophs are organisms that get their food from something else so they don't make it on their own they consume their food this is also a heter trro and this is also a hetro and when we go up a food chain or a food web we can also identify organisms as producers or consumers so this is a producer this is a primary consumer because it's the first organism that eats the producer this is a secondary consumer and this is a tertiary consumer if the human were to eat the Bobcat on a trophic pyramid remember that the most energy is found at the bottom of the pyramid and as you go up a level most of that energy is lost to the environment so it's more efficient to consume lower on at trophic pyramid if you're an organism there are tons of different mod molecules and atoms cycling throughout our environment carbon is one of them and the carbon cycle involves both photosynthesis the plants harnessing sunlight energy in order to take the carbon dioxide from the air and create glucose molecules respiration we take that glucose and we use it to create energy and then we exhale the carbon dioxide decomposition can break down carbon in organisms bodies and combustion also releases carbon dioxide into the environment now there are tons of resources on Earth some are renewable which means they can be replaced quickly by natural processes some are non-renewable meaning they cannot be replaced generally within human lifetimes or as fast as they are being used and so we need to consider the our use of resources as the population of humans continues to boom on planet Earth a hole in the ozone layer is a problem that we've identified recently but it's actually getting better but this hole produced by the use of cfc's or a chemical called chlorofluorocarbons was pretty dangerous cuz it was letting in armful UV radiation into the earth now this is separate from the issue of global warming which is predominantly affected by the combustion or burning of fossil fuels because that adds gases to the atmosphere that cause it to hold more heat and continued global warming can lead to rising sea levels coastal flooding but there are other human impacts plenty of human impacts on the environment such as introduction of invasive species introduction of diseases changing habitats deforestation industrialization all of these things but humans can also have a positive impact on the environment by reducing our consumption of resources recycling planting native species protecting wildlife and habitats and supporting sustainable practices wo we're coming to the end I hope this has been helpful as you cram for your biology exam I have lots of other biology AP biology and other life science

        "transcription": "4 billion years ago something very strange happened on this planet we call it life and I dare any person any of you to tell me that it isn't the most interesting thing that has ever happened thankfully for all of us it's still happening it's happening as much if not more than ever it's squishy slippery and and slimy and sticky and spiky and you'll find all the shapes Moss shaped mosquito shaped manate shaped new shaped in all the sizes too from Tiny to tremendous in everything in between and biology is the study of this thing we call life we study biology for a whole bunch of different reasons from the obvious like making new medicines to the not so obvious like learning how to identify misinformation and we use biology to describe anything that life does quick are you breathing right now that is a biological process life does a lot of stuff but it's not so easy to pin down what life is like okay for sure that ant is alive it responds to its environment like the crumm it just found and it must reproduce based on how many of these ants I see coming right now but other things respond to their environment too like if that's our definition is fire alive is a computer virus alive is the robot vacuum I call my personal Butler alive now I'm a bit biased as a biologist and a living thing but life is the most interesting thing to have ever happened on Earth and we are not even sure what it is hi I'm Dr Sammy and this is crashcourse biology wait am I alive but I I am alive right because we just introduced some serious uncertainty [Music] here life feels like something you know when you see it but humans have wrestled with how to define it for centuries like the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle thought the ability to grow reproduce and react to inner and outer forces set life apart from non-life he was off track with some other observations like he thought that women have fewer teeth than men and that eels are made of mud but on the subject of life he was really on to something modern day biologists tend to agree that life involves a state of chemical balance that reproduces and evolves over Generations in fact that's also the definition that Nasa uses should they ever see signs of such a thing beyond Earth a self-sustaining chemical system capable of evolution but for now here on Earth generations of scientists have developed a list of seven characteristics that sort the stones not alive from the stone fish definitely alive we know you're there stonefish you can't trick us no matter how good that disguise is first living things keep their inner conditions steady as outer conditions change and that's called regulation like on a scorching hot day when I am ripping sweat and my dog is panting our bodies are using two different strategies for the same life- sustaining goal regulating our temperature second living things respond to their environment that includes Dramatics like when a fast and furious cheetas Sprints after a gazelle or house cats imagining that they're cheetah but they're actually batting at house flies but it's also the slow motion stuff of the plant world like the turn of a flower towards the Sun or a Vine twisting on a branch third living things reproduce passing on genetic information to their offspring and that includes the bouncing baby giraffe who inherited her father's eyelashes and her mother's extra thick tail hair but it also includes a single celled yeast splitting in two making more of itself in its own image oh yeasty the 52nd carrying on the family name fourth living things also grow and develop based on the instruction in their jeans reading those instructions triggers a tadpole to turn into a frog or a teenage boy's voice to change unfortunately jeans can't prevent those instructions from being read the day before his solo of Oh Holy Night terrible timing there when when all in one night your voice goes from Mariah Carey to Barry White oh yeah baby it's a bit of a mess fifth all living things process energy to do their well living things like my body is using nutrients from a Greek salad right now to breathe pump blood and talk to you and all that energy was processed by the living things that supplied my lunch so this episode of Crash Course is brought to you in part by a lettuce plant an olive tree and oddly enough the milk of a sheep sixth life is organized even in living things that seem chaotically arranged to humanize I'm looking at platypus yeah even those weirdos have a sense of order structuring their bodies from the cells up those groups of cells arranged into tissues organs and organ systems keep whole organisms functioning and last on the list living things have adaptations shaped by a history of evolution these adaptations are traits that help organisms survive and reproduce individuals that survive and reproduce pass on their genes and traits ass associated with them that's how the Platypus ended up with such a weird cool body that that includes not just webbed feet but also venomous Spurs to battle their Rivals like what are you even doing with those buddy you have almost no native predators don't don't you point those at me wander around with this checklist of life and you can find evidence of it in lots of interesting forms beetles ferns algae yourself your neighbor I mean please ask first before looking for that evidence don't don't spy on your neighbor and at the same time some of these traits can be found in non-living things too like take snowflakes definitely organized but they don't process energy or think about fire it grows but it can't reproduce and then there are some real edge cases the gray areas where our definition of what's living and what's not really gets pushed to the Limit let's head to the thought B meet the virus a tiny bundle of jeans in a protein jacket even smaller than a cell on their own in their little protein jackets viruses just kind of hang out they can't reproduce they can't grow they cannot process energy they don't even regulate themselves because nothing's really happening they're like really complicated dust but when those jackets Come Off watch out viruses seem wildly alive their genetic information replicates they spread between living things multiplying to infect other cells and just like cockroaches cactuses and chimpanzees they evolve over many generations but there is a catch a virus can't do any of those things without first taking over a host cell they can't take action to infect they have no system for responding to their environment they are totally dependent on bumping into the right cell at the right time behind every lifelike virus is a cell that has been commandeered to do all the work in fact viruses like rabies direct their host so convincingly that 19th century scientists thought that they were among the simplest forms of life but today most biologists would say viruses aren't alive and I'd like to emphasize most instead viruses sit alongside life in a way they borrow life and yet we also know that viruses have been around a long time almost as long as cells themselves they've evolved to infect everything from single cell amoeba to 150 ton blue whales so as life has evolved viruses have been along for a lot of the ride thanks th bubble of course all that said we don't know what life might look like outside of planet Earth in fact there's a whole field of biology called astrobiology devoted to thinking up what extraterrestrial life might look like by examining some of the most extreme forms of life here on Earth biologists might one day decide to add to the list or tweak it depending on what that non-terrestrial life looks like when it's discovered but for now our planet is the only one that we know sustains life ultimately there is still room for here our qualifications for life let us draw a circle that keeps life inside and non-life outside but don't be surprised if it's the kind of thing that human thinking continues to change on especially when and if we get better at making things that may or may not be alive debating what does and doesn't count as life might seem kind of up in the clouds but hey if we didn't how else would we know that there are living micr up in those clouds that affect the weather that's right biology is everywhere is responsible for the medicine that you take when you get a headache and for the vaccines that protect you from serious illness it's in the cotton of your T-shirt and the Apple in your lunch both brought to you by plants that have captured the energy from the Sun and guess what biology is in you it's in the organs and cells and tissues that make everything about you possible whether that's sneezing or laughing or digesting lunch writing a poem or riding a bike and it doesn't end there no matter what size or shape life takes every living thing is connected to every other living thing every bug bat and bacterium shares a common ancestor a single- celled organism that lived about four billion years ago but it's not just Evolution that connects us the very molecules that make up our bodies were born in the heart of a fiery star long before earth was formed and that same stard dust will move on after we're gone to make up new ones in a way you have just as much claim to the title of Heavenly Body as Jupiter or Venus this interconnectedness can be mindblowing and perspective changing but it's not just something to Marvel at in the abstract it's also a practical puzzle piece that helps us understand ourselves and our future like by knowing that we're connected to mice on the family tree ethically studying them can help us find cures for human diseases and because life is connected by big biological processes we can understand how our actions affect the water the land the climate and in turn Us by showing us life's interconnectedness biology can help us and is helping us find solutions to some of our biggest challenges like hunger disease and climate change so yeah biology is everywhere because life is all around us and by highlighting the Wild web of connections between you and every other living thing biology helps us understand ourselves and each other and hopefully create a better future for all kinds of life when biologists and really people of all kinds ask seemingly philosophical questions like what is life and how is everything connected or practical questions like how do cancer cells reproduce and what are the effects of climate change on ecosystems they're participating in something bigger something we call the scientific process but we'll talk more about that next time this series was produced in collaboration with

        "transcription": "this is science Max experiments at large science Max our maxed out rocket worked great now to make it look more like a rocket so we have a mesh bag here to put the antd in right and we have um some paper clips attached to it and what are the paper clips for well Phil we have a magnet ah and so the magnet sticks to the paperclip and so that's what we have here you see the bag is full of the ant acid tablets which we put through the mouth of the bottle and the magnet is holding the paper clips on the other side of the plastic so we can sort of move it along so we can start with the bag over here where the waterers down there but now we attach the launcher like so all this effort is to keep the reaction from happening until the bottle's on the launcher and we're ready to go and then as we pull the bottle over we bring the bag up this side and there the water and the an acid have never touched no reaction all you need to do now is just we pull this magnet away and the bag will fall into the water and then we will have the launcher down here and we pull the release and the rocket will go we add some weight to the launcher to help keep it in place okay right wait glasses safety first okay ready and then we pull the string with the magnet that drops the bag of an acid tablets in the water and starts the chemical reaction because we have a latch holding the bottle down we can wait until the chemical reaction happens fully and there's a lot of gas pressure in the rocket before 3 2 one one that worked yeah I hit the ceiling uh I think we need to do this outside yeah I think we definitely have to do it outside all right totally great weird anyway I was saying we should put three or four of three two one [Music] go there it is go yeah we tried it outside and it worked great the only thing left was to Max it out even more so larger chamber yep more ant acid more ant acid more air more water absolutely bigger rocket okay so you know what I know how to splice two bottles together and we can increase the size of the chamber this is sodium acetate how do you get sodium acetate well when you do a vinegar and baking soda reaction what you have left once the reaction is finished is sodium acetate it's a crystal and you can do something fun with it that may seem familiar you make a super saturated solution of sodium acetate by heating water and dissolving as much as you can and then when it cools you can get the crystals to reform now if you did this with sugar you could make a sugar pop which we've done before if you do it with salt you could make a salt pop Which is less appealing and if you do it with sodium acetate you can do this just like with the sugar pop all it needs is a seed Crystal to get the crystals to reform but unlike sugar which takes a few days sodium acetate recrystallizes right before your eyes because we heated the water it allowed more crystals to dissolve in it ooh but then it cooled down afterward there's more crystals sitting around in this water than there should be at this temperature they want to turn back into crystals and all they need is something to start them going I've colored this one green because I don't know science maybe it'll look cool a tiny Crystal on the end of the stick is all we need to start the reaction happening w wow and there you go sodium acetate H that one wasn't done yet tornadoes are giant weather systems that cause the air to go around and around tornadoes can be pretty dangerous but they don't happen that often here's how you can make your own small pet tornado you can play with at home because air and water behave similarly we can make a water tornado you spin it around get it going and taada your very own pet tornado here's how you do it you take two 2 lit plastic bottles and fill one with water and some blue food coloring is what I like to do and then tape the mouths of the bottles together you might need an adult to help you with this because you want to make sure the bottles are perfectly aligned then flip it over spin it around to get it going and voila your very own pet tornado awesome and now we're going to Max it out with a giant tornado chamber here's an experiment you can do with a bag of water take a sharpened pencil and carefully push it through the bag if you do it carefully it won't spill the reason this works is because the bag is made of polymers long stretchy chains of molecules and also because the pressure of the water against the pencil prevents any water from spilling out now we're going to Max it out this is a very large bag of water and here I have some very large pencils you ready oh that's one that's two here we go should I go from the bottom taada science okay okay okay I know what you want like I was saying science and the denser liquids push the lighter liquid up and now we're going to add the yellow which of course has no sugar in it at all and there you go all the layers stay separate if you put it on a light you can really see it liquid densities now let's Max it out Tada the longest length of liquid layers 12 liquids all organ organized by density starting from the bottom we have honey corn syrup chocolate syrup maple syrup dish soap whole milk water dyed blue vegetable oil extra virgin olive oil rubbing alcohol baby oil and lamp oil liquid density I really really want to mix it up but it took me a long time to make this so I'm not going to help I'm being crushed by all this pressure a whole kilogram is being pushed down on every Square centimeter of my body 103 kilop picles actually one kilogram for every Square centimeter on your body is the exact kind of pressure that you and I are under at all times every day we don't notice it because we're used to it but it sounds like a lot doesn't it well it is here's an experiment you can do with a plastic bottle say at room temperature there are 10 million air molecules in here doesn't really matter how many but we'll say there's 10 million at normal room temperature what happens if I heat up the air inside this bottle this is warm water what I'm trying to do is heat up the air inside the bottle because the air molecules when they get hotter move faster and need more room so the 10 million air molecules are starting to escape out the mouth of the bottle and reducing the number of air molecules inside and now I take the bottle out out and cap it because the air molecules heated up and speeded up they needed more room now there's less of them in the bottle there's about 4 million air molecules inside this bottle but they're all hot air molecules and they have a higher pressure and you don't notice it because the air out here isn't crushing the bottle but watch what happens if I cool the air inside the bottle this is ice water so what's happening now is the molecules are slowing down and they need less space so they need less room and they're being crushed by the pressure on the outside of the bottle it has been crushed because the colder air molecules don't need the same kind of room as the hot air molecules the room temperature air has crushed the bottle the air inside has a lower pressure than the air outside pretty amazing if you attach something ferromagnetic like this washer to a magnet not only does it stick but the magnetic field travels down the metal making it a magnet too which means you can stick more and more things to each other and they will continue to stick until you run out of magnetic field you can do this yourself at home with anything ferromagnetic paper clips work pretty well or washers like a have or screws or bolts and they'll continue to stick to each other as long as the magnetic field is strong enough you can see it's getting pretty weak here and they'll all stay magnetized as long as the first one is still attached to the magnet but if you want to go even further all you need to do is keep adding more magnets to reinforce the magnetic field I've got a few here point this get the chain started like that and then I've got a magnet attached to this washer so it will keep the magnetic field strong and I continue to add one magnet one washer and we'll just see how far I can go you can even sculpt it a little bit look at that and then at the end a whole bunch of paper clips eventually the weight will make it fall off but it's a lot of fun to play with magnets and make art speaking of art you can make with magnets you can also make sculptures when everything sticks to everything else you can make some pretty fancy designs this is a rare earth magnet a very strong one and a bunch of nuts that I've gotten and this one here is an electromagnet but electromagnets are a little different because they need an electric current to work check this out this is sort of a magnet dude with crazy hair there's a earth magnet here and this is a giant screw and these are some metal bits and then I've got two more magnets at the top here to hold on his crazy wire hair he's got crazy wire hair because he's crazy magnitude now of course we couldn't just talk about magnetic sculptures without maxing it out so let's Max it out this is a bunch of scrap metal from leftover experiments and I've got a bunch of rare earth magnets and now I'm going to max out a magnet sculpture see there you go a maxed out magnet me I made this guy out of metal pipes with Earth magnets in between and these are his arms attached of course with magnets his hand his little metal pieces attached with magnet steel wool for the hair and of course hat non- magnetic all right here we go ready uh want to see a magic trick simple copper tube drop things through [Music] it nothing unusual happens but watch when I drop a magnet through what it's not magic it's science because the magnet creates a magnetic field when it goes through the tube the magnetic field repels the magnet upwards now the field isn't perfect so the magnet doesn't come to a stop but still it slows down from a fall to a nice graceful drop take a look from above pretty amazing right magnets not magic science a delicious plate of cheese and crackers my favorite snack but these crackers are pretty salty so I should probably pour myself a glass of of water first huh no my chees are crackers why why does this happen why does the water stick to the glass well because of Science and the reason why it happens gets a little complicated but it boils down to this one simple thing water likes to stick to things huh huh did you see did you see how it's stuck no of course you didn't you know why because it only sticks on a small scale see those drops of water that's water sticking to the surface but it only works when the surface tension of the water is less than the force of gravity which is why Water Drops Fall when they get bigger so it sticks to things that still doesn't explain why you can pour water out of some containers without any drips and other containers make it nearly impossible it's all about the angle water will flow very easily when there isn't a large change in Direction like around the curved top of this glass but when there's a big change in Direction like at the mouth of this teapot the water can't make that turn as easily this is also why pouring from a full glass is much messier than one that's less full pouring out of a full glass the water only needs to change direction this much to flow down the side but from a half full glass the water would need to change direction this much so all this happens because water likes to stick to things so let's do an experiment and coat this glass with hydrophobic spray now hydrophobic Coatings repel rep water so if it's repelling the water from the outside of the glass will we still have the same problem well let's find out hydrophobic coated glass nonhydrophobic coated glass or just regular glass water likes to stick to surfaces but it can't stick to one coated in hydrophobic coating that's impressive should we try something else well that's one way to solve the dribbling glass problem except you can't coat your glasses at home with hydrophobic coating because it's not good to eat the secret is using a container that has a very sharp angle between where you're pouring the water and the underside of the glass like this jug and there you go now I can enjoy a nice glass of water with my cheese and crackers uh oh right I am wait hold on I can re I will remake the crackers into see look see it's just it's fine it's fine I'm not really going to eat that I'm just kidding Chris and I are maxing out our hydraulic Crusher yes yes before we get to that I have a little game I want to play okay great okay you can pick either the small one the big one okay so what's the game simple thumb war I'm going to press down on this side you press on that side we'll see you win okay okay ready 1 2 3 go oh wow that was really tough why was that so hard well F I'm just really strong wait a minute my turn Okay one 2 3 go yeah see pushing down on this one is way easier you wouldn't think that the small syringe would be easier why is that the reason for it is is that you have to push this one down a lot farther than you have to push this one down see see how far this one goes and this one's barely this one travels much more this is how we can exchange a little bit of force over a long distance that's right to a a little bit of distance and a lot of force that's exactly right just like the lever it's a mechanical advantage but in this case it's hydraulic advantage that's right Chris and I push down on small syringes which gives us more force on our larger syringes our Crusher was ready to go ooh how about an orange one two 3 we squeeze down [Applause] [Music] and then we tried a walnut are you allergic to nuts I am not 1 2 [Applause] 3 when we try to golf ball we reach the limit of what our plastic syringes and our hands could do we need to come up with a stronger more awesome crushing machine using Hydraulics that's right I have some ideas okay good we can go to we can use metal we can use metal and we can use and we can go bigger as well ew this water is gross but I'm going to drink this water why well because of science no but I'm not going to drink the water like this first I'm going to use the power of science to help me clean it how by using gravel gravel yes gravel so say I've got some dirty water and there are particles floating in that water large particles your rocks your wood these styrofoam bits will act as the large particles you pour it into the gravel and the large particles get filtered out see nothing but clean clean water yeah I know what you're thinking Phil that's not really clean yet that's because we haven't done step two sand sand yes sand let's say that these plastic beads are small particles that filters out the tinier stuff there huh clean right no it's not very clean so we filter the water in the next step with charcoal what charcoal yes charcoal charcoal works just like gravel and sand except on a microscopic scale say these bits are tiny particles you can't even see the charcoal catches these like the sand and gravel caught the larger particles this is called a gravel sand and charcoal filter the gravel catches the big particles the sand the smaller ones and the charcoal the microscopic ones these kinds of filters are used all over the world to clean drinking water ah delicious science now it is time to talk about an amazing natural polymer it is hagfish slime um still well hagfish that's probably just an unfortunate name for the fish I'm I'm sure the fish itself doesn't H okay so hagfish makes slime apparently when a hagfish is attacked by something that wants to eat it like a shark or an eel it secretes a tiny bit of a natural polymer that's this little white bit right here at the end of this test tube now it doesn't look like much right now but it reacts with seawater watch this hagfish slime is very interesting to scientists because you start with just a tiny little bit and add seawat and suddenly you have a lot of slime this stuff is actually pretty cool hagfish slime is a natural polymer it's made just the same as the other polymers at of long chains of molecules but it's naturally produced by a living organism and because it's naturally produced that means it's biodegradable hagfish slime it's pretty cool after all nothing like a fizzy glass of water and now there are ways for you to carbonate water at home with something like this the science Max carbonation station you have a bottle of compressed carbon dioxide gas that's hooked up you take a bottle of tap water attach it and carbonate it voila carbonated water but this this is science Max why just carbonate water let's carbonate everything let's carbonate pickle [Music] juice it's actually amazing milk it's like milk meets water kind of very odd chocolate milk oh no that's way better carbonated mustard carbonated tomato juice carbonated hot sauce no wait carbonated that was the hot sauce carbonated clam chowder oh there you go carbonation not just for water anymore it is definitely not for clam chowder no that's just a big bowl of no never again pressure happens when you squeeze something or compress it solids do not compress very well I will demonstrate um solid is it compressing no okay liquids don't compress very well either you can demonstrate this for yourself by getting a plastic water bottle and filling it right to the very top with water and putting on the cap and squeezing you'll find that you can't really squeeze the bottle very much but if you empty out half of the water no don't pour it on the floor and then put the cap back on the bottle and try to squeeze it you'll find that you can squeeze it a lot more that's because gases compress much easier than solids or liquids here's what's going on say this container is well any container and these magnets are air molecules now I'm going to put the magnets in pole to pole so they repel each other and want to stay a certain distance apart just like air molecules do there we go a container at normal gas pressure now watch what happens when I add more gas molecules they start to get squeezed together and if I add more the amount of space that each one gets is less and less now this container is under a lot of pressure these molecules really want to escape through the top of the container but they can't because I'm holding them down if I took something like this plunger and I pushed them down even more now they're really Under Pressure they want to get out but they can't because I'm holding them in now watch what happens when I let them go they all pop out the top and the container has returned to normal gas pressure that that's what happens when we put gas in a container like this one these containers that hold compressed gas are made out of solid steel because you need something really strong or it might explode if you put too much gas pressure in it that's why these are only filled up by professionals who know exactly how much pressure it can take that is the power of pressure today we're taking a closer look at chemistry ooh chemistry is the science of atoms and molecules the things that make up all matter and how they interact with each other take for example this glow stick actually don't take it cuz I I I kind of need it the glow stick doesn't glow until you um the glow stick doesn't glow until you break the barrier and mix the two chemicals and they start to Glow huh pretty cool huh chemistry now the chemical reaction we're looking at today is the old vinegar and baking soda volcano but this reaction doesn't have anything to do with volcanoes it's chemistry now this experiment is totally safe but I do recommend you get an adult's permission before you do it because it's very messy uh uh yeah first you're going to want baking soda and vinegar these are your two main ingredients but you'll also want dish soap and red food coloring if you want it to look a little bit more like lava now I like to mix the baking soda red food coloring and dish soap together with a little warm water so all you have to do is add the vinegar and when you do this is what [Music] happens and there you go chemical reaction now I know you're thinking you're thinking Phil how much vinegar or baking soda do I use well I'm not going to tell you this is where you can be science Maxim mites try different amounts more vinegar more baking soda more dish soap who knows write down the amounts each time you use it and find out what amounts work best that's called science greeting science maxm mites today we're using fizzy drinks in our experiments and a fizzy drink is just water with bubbles of carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it so I thought since we exhale carbon dioxide I could make a fizzy drink by just blowing bubbles in this water doesn't seem to be working though does it I don't see any bubbles do you no h water does absorb carbon dioxide gas but I don't have a fizzy drink weird time to check the book of science oh in order to make bubbles you have to have pressure so this is an a air compressor it takes air and compresses it puts it under pressure so H the container needs to be pressurized okay when you get a container of a fizzy drink the carbon dioxide gas is put in there under pressure and it stays in there under pressure until you release it that that's the sound of the pressure being released and when it is released the carbon dioxide gas starts to expand and when it expands it creates Bubbles and that's what makes your fizzy drink this process takes a while to run out but eventually it will become flat no more bubbles but what if there was a way to release all of that carbonation all in one go well there is and for this experiment all you need is your favorite brand of fizzy drink science Max brand diet science Cola 100% science zero calories and your favorite candy like these science experim mints all the minty flavor that comes from Pure science so all you need to do is open this up open this up take one of these and put it in here with an adult's permission because it can get kind of messy what's going on here is all of the carbonation that was in the bottle is now being released much more rapidly than it would have been before now why does this happen well if you look at a carbonated beverage you'll see that the bubbles don't come from everywhere they come from the inside of the glass or in this case a lot are coming from the straw and that's because the carbon dioxide bubbles like to find a little imperfection something to hold on to in order to expand and bubble out and a candy such as this has a ton of little tiny microscopic imperfections so when you drop it in there's a lot more places for the bubbles to attach and that makes the carbonation happen a lot quicker but remember this is not a chemical reaction it all has to do with carbonation so that's what we're going to be looking at today air pressure more pressure less pressure and of course we're going to be maxing out this experiment greetings science maximite my name is Phil and this is science Max experiments at large today we're going to be looking at earthquakes earthquakes huh today we're going to be looking at how to build something that was supposed to happen earlier today we're going to be looking at how to build something that stands up to the shaking of an earthquake earthquakes happen when two plates on the Earth's surface rub together and it causes the ground to shake it causes the ground to shake sometimes it shakes a little sometimes it shakes a lot chances are you do not live in a place that has earthquakes but if you do ask an adult what to do during an earthquake so you can be safe modern buildings that are built in earthquake zones are designed to withstand the shaking but how do scientists and engineers build a building that stands up to the shaking of an earthquake [Music] well that's what we're going to be looking at today first thing we have to do is simulate an earthquake we're going to build a Shaker table and here's what you need two books and two books four elastic bands and four four rubber balls wait okay four four rubber balls all right so the first thing you do is actually take your four elastic bands and wrap them around your books put one set on one side one set on the other side till you have that then you take your four balls and you stick them in between the books in the middle is area but you don't want to have them too close to the edges and now two at the back and TAA you've made your own Shaker table what are you shaking you'll ask I will show you you build a tower like this one here that I built out of building blocks so here's what you do you'll need your base to be securely attached to the Shaker table I use painter tape because it'll come off again without harming the books and what I want to find out is just how much shaking this Tower can take before it falls apart [Music] ready and there it goes and when you've done that what you do is you be a science maximite and you design another Tower and you tape it down to your Shaker table and see if you can make this Tower fall down in an earthquake and if you built it really well probably won't but you don't have to just use building blocks there's all kinds of other materials you can use check out this building which is really tall and you'll see there's a cup at the top and that's for a baseball put it up at the top and that means there's a weight up there and then we shake it and we see what happens oh oh no oh there it goes and that's the last one Lisa and I are maxing out our chemical powered rocket not by making it bigger but by making more of them how many more 400 caps all glued down 400 ant acid tablets or part of yep all glued down and they're glued on this fancy pancy spinning surface so we rotate this part upside down we fill each container with a little water and snap it on underneath this way the antacid tablet and the water don't mix until we flip it back over it also allows us time to snap them all on okay ready ready all right 400 containers here we go let's do it once we flipped the board back over the reaction started taking place building up carbon dioxide gas and increasing the pressure until oh yeah oh yeah oh my goodness good luck if you catch one wow that one went really high awesome that totally was great wow okay so high five's on that that worked spectacularly that was awesome so we've done this let's go bigger let's go bigger okay so let's go we'll clean this up afterwards okay okay let it go time for a minx here's how you can use the forces of things spinning around to defy gravity well sort of take a ping pong ball and put it in a plastic container like a cup or this is the top of a CD spindle put it in and start spinning it around if you do it right you can get the ball spinning only on the sides of your container and not touching the bottom that's centripetal force at work oh it works a lot better and it's much more impressive if you have something that doesn't have a bottom fortunately I do this bucket doesn't have a bottom put the pingpong ball in the bucket and spin it around and if I'm very careful I can lift the bucket into the air and TAA I'm defying the force of gravity science all right tell you ready y you're going to pour all your baking soda in the fish tank and I'm going to pour the vinegar into this bucket because you don't want to don't want to pour them together right away okay you ready yep okay go for it when you're doing your PhD in chemistry do you get to do stuff like this yeah really got to do a lot of fun reactions in the lab oh that's I'm I'm jealous have you ever done this much vinegar and baking soda in one time I can't say I ever have there you go that's what I like to hear I already put the soap in the bucket so it would mix with the vinegar when I poured it in are you done your baking soda already I am I'll pour faster faster smells vinegary it smells vinegar it makes me one french fries okay Tel you take this very full bucket of vinegar and dish soap thank you I will take this one uhoh we still have our third bucket okay I'm going to I'll do these both at the same time okay ready on the count of three one two [Applause] three okay that's awesome so the one thing it didn't do it didn't shoot up in the air though yeah it's because the top is quite open so you would need to constrict it to get it to shoot up oh yeah cuz we're using just sort of a square a rectangular prism container we should get something that's maybe something more like our vinegar bottle right cuz there's lots of space down here but then it forces it into a tighter opening at the top there um like a volcano Y and what else can we do uh to make it even more powerful to Max it out vinegar is only 5% acid the rest is water so you could try using 100% so what kind of acid is vinegar it's acetic acid so vinegar is actually only 5% acetic acid yep and 95% water so you can get 100% acetic acid yeah can you get 100% acetic acid yeah awesome why don't we get a container that's sort of shaped like a funnel like a volcano and 100% acetic acid we'll do it again sounds good all right let's do it here's another way to defy gravity using friction get a plastic water bottle and fill it with rice take two so get a plastic water bottle and fill it with rice using a funnel then take a shishkabob skewer and stick it into the bottle and nothing happens but if you tap the bottle down the rice starts to pack in a little bit better see how the level of rice is lower which means you can add more rice pack it down even more and you can even use something the same diameter as the mouth of the bottle like say a highlighter and make sure all the rice is as packed in as you can get it there now the rice is really packed in there and when I stick the shish kebab skewer in the friction between the pieces of rice and this wood is enough to lift the bottle using nothing but friction now let's Max it out I filled this 20 L water cooler jug full of rice and it's really it's really heavy I wanted to see if I could lift it using nothing but friction and this dowel which is just a round piece of wood all right here we [Music] go science I'd Max it out even more but I don't I don't think I could lift anymore this is a chain of beads and this is a glass now if I was to drop the chain of beads what will happen it will fall yes that's right it'll fall because of gravity but watch this this side goes up why because of gravity wait a minute wait a minute why does one side go up because of gravity well it gets a little complicated but I can explain um but I think I should I have to put the beads back in the glass okay so what's going on well when this part of the chain starts falling out it gets longer and longer and it has more mass than this side of the chain and if it has more mass then it has more inertia and when it starts yanking out very hard this side of the chain gets yanked up out of the glass very quickly when it gets yanked up hard it flies into the air but then of course the direction has to change so it goes around a curve and then goes back down because of the speed that it's going that curve starts lifting up over the top of the glass and that's how it works there's a big difference in energy because this chain Falls far I try it from here and it doesn't work as well why because the drop from here to here isn't as big you want lots of force acting on the falling chain which means the higher you do it from the better it works so maybe we should Max it out yeah oh wait we should wait for it to stop here's another fun way you can play with elastic Force take a milk carton I prefer science Max Milk because it's the creamiest 2% cream 100% science wrap some elastic bands around it with some popsicle sticks on the bottom sort of like feet then take some clamshell packaging which wraps just about anything you buy nowadays and cut out a square or a rectangle then wrap some tape around that square with an elastic in it and put the elastic on the feet of your milk carton then wind it around and make sure you go backwards so your Paddle Wheel boat will go forwards when you put it in the [Music] water and there you go a Paddle Wheel boat now it is time to Max it out [Music] aoy the SS max out elastic Force Paddle Wheel boat mattress I need I need a better name but I've made a giant Paddle Wheel boat that will work on elastic Force because I've got surgical tubing as my elastics and that's an air mattress and then I use some Lumber to hold it all together and of course I need a Paddle Wheel and what better thing to use in a pool than a flutter board okay here we go so normally you're not allowed to wear your clothes and your shoes in the pool but I got special permission because of signs besides I'm not worried at all so I didn't wear my swimming outfit because I figure I can totally do this entire experiment without even getting wet that is how confident I am all right now the tricky part we'll be getting on to the mattress okay here we go the SS science hey SS science it's a great name for this look it works great and I manag to say totally dry huh well almost oh oh you thought I was going to fall in the pool but I didn't uhoh my flutter board has has stopped moving and I'm I'm in the middle of the pool almost yeah didn't think this through no no no no that's not going to work maybe I'll maybe I'll wait all right let's build our catapult the first step take four pencils and stick your Popsicle stick in between so you have two on the top and two on the bottom and then use your elastic to go around and around and around that's why I like building things with elastics because it makes it very fast to tie things together because once you go around and you have it nice and tight you just pop it over the end and voila it stays together and that is how you start making your frame put more pencils on that side and another popsicle stick on the other end held on at the corners with more elastics then take even more elastics and put them right around the middle until you get this I've added a few more elastics around the middle here and that is where we're going to get all of our elastic Force I think I have six the more you use the better it's going to work take your Popsicle stick stick in between the elastics and then start spinning it around here's the reason I use pencils and popsicle sticks is because the pencils are a little bit longer which allows you to twist the popsicle stick around in the middle and build up the elastic Force now because I'm twisting the elastic Force we're using here is called torsion or twisting force when you feel you have enough torsion pull your Popsicle stick down a little bit so it won't unwind on you and you'll see that you have all kinds of elastic energy then take your spoon and stick it on the popsicle stick and you can also break off the popsicle stick if you want to make sure it's the right length and it works like that to make the frame you just need more pencils and elastics the trick is to make a triangle with two pencils attached to your frame they should stick up right where your catapult arm would be fully upright then take a final pencil and put it across the top don't forget to pull the arm back before you put the pencil across otherwise it'll end up on the wrong side now this is very complicated and I went pretty fast so if you want the step-by-step instructions on exactly how to build this go to our website and there you go a catapult of your very own that you can use to knock down very small castle walls I've also built a larger catapult using all of the same principles pretty good huh it's got a longer arm which means I can throw marshmallows even further whoa or I can throw larger marshmallows or I can throw very large marshmallows now I know what you're thinking you're thinking Phil is that the largest catapult you're going to make well of course not this is science Max experiments at large this science is delicious this is rock candy it's basically crystallized sugar and you make it by turning a solid into a liquid and then back to a solid again here's how you can make it at [Applause] home you need a container that you're not going to need for a while and some water some sugar you can use brown or white I like to use Brown and an adult here's why you need an adult you want to dissolve three cups of sugar into every cup of water and you can't do that unless you heat the water so get an adult a saucepan and heat the water up pour the sugar in and keep stirring until it's all dissolved then pour it in your container and let it cool down then you'll need a shish kebab skewer which is something you can get at the grocery store cut it down to the right size so it fits nicely into your container and then dunk it in your sugar and get some crystals coated around the stick these are seed crystals and they get the whole process started and now you have to wait for these to dry otherwise they'll just fall off the stick when you put it in the water so I've got one here that has dried out you'll also want something to keep it from falling in the top of the container so I'm going to use a clo pin put it in there and dunk it in the container like that and now for the final step if you want you can add food coloring I like to use red because it reminds me of Science and I'm going to use the stick to actually stir that up a little bit there we go now the dissolved sugar crystals in the water will slowly grow on the crystals that are already attached to the the stick and it will eventually grow into a rock candy pop but it takes about a week no I'm just kidding I've already got one that's standing by here we go this one has been growing for about 7 days and there you go rock candy delicious Science Now how could we make this any better I mean it's crystallized sugar it doesn't get any more maxed out than that does it yeah it does come on this is a giant container of sugar water and I've been brewing a massive rock candy crystal in it for a while but it's sort of it's sort of getting a little bit too big to fit out the top of the container so um you know what I'm just going to put that back in there and chalk that one up to science because well eating a rock candy crystal that big would definitely not be good for my teeth so [Music] yeah this is Pharaoh fluid it is ferromagnetic which means it's attracted to magnets and I know what you're thinking you're thinking it's not that interesting well watch as I put it next to this magnet very interesting and because it's a liquid it behaves in very interesting ways watch this unlike most things ferromagnetic like paper clips or iron filings ferrofluid is a liquid which means it behaves in a unique way the spikes it creates are following the magnetic field lines of the magnet you can see the magnetic field in 3D it's even more impressive when we Max it out this is ferof fluid outside of a glass jar now it's sitting in a pool around this electromagnet and this is a dial which I can use to change the voltage of the electromagnet making the magnet stronger watch this changing the current going to the spiral in the middle turns it into a magnet the more current I put in the stronger that magnet becomes allowing the ferof fluid to climb the spiral to the top and remember even though it looks all spiky it's still a liquid I will demonstrate with my plastic spoon and watch this when I turn the magnet off it stops being spiky turn it on turn it off science The Wizard Academy all you have to do is demonstrate true magic and you will be granted entry well fuzzi who is the next applicant for The Wizard Academy overwhel inde it is I no overwhelm and prepare to be overwhelmed would you be flabber gasified if I balanced this coin on its end not really no but would you be impressed if I was to balance this coin on top of this coin possibly prepare to be flustered and stupified stupy stupy flustered as I balance three coins on their ends on top of this glass well that certainly would seem like magic let us see okay no pressure overwhel you can do this and now I say the magic word a magic word and now you must let me into your Academy wait what's under the cloth what what cloth this cloth nothing is that a magnet this no the pull of the magnet is what's keeping those coins up the magnet is just strong enough to keep the coins from falling no this is set set dressing it's just for it was a good trick but it's science not magic well yes and you will see you will see I will be back I overwhelm will return and I will do such magic that you will need extra socks because I will knock them off with my magic you will need at least two pairs of so maybe three pairs of socks we can still see you no you can't this is water things float on water like Po po noodles and wood and toy boats and now we're going to do an experiment with how paint floats on water how's this supposed to work again oh I'm supposed to take the paint out of the can first this is a fun experiment you can do at home all you need is a container some water and paint but not just any paint special paint you use for hydro dipping that's Hydro meaning water and dipping meaning dipping carefully pour the paint on the water and add a few different colors then take a stick to swirl it up into a pattern then you get something you want to paint and you carefully put it in like so but don't pull it out as soon as you get it in you have to spread the paint away because it'll stick when you bring it back out and then when you pull it out W hydro dip let that dry and then you have a very very cool painted toy let's do some other stuff this is a bike helmet if you put tape on what you're painting you can remove it later to make parts that aren't painted skateboard oh that's pretty cool now to Max it out hydro dip pants wearing the pants when you do this is super messy and not something you should try at home but the results weren't bad science pants science pants giant pants one of the ways you can experience the power of water is watching it wash away dirt you can experiment with this yourself by making your own erosion table to make your own fill a plastic tub with sand and tilt it up cut a hole in the tub at the low end and put a hose with a trickle of water at the high end then to complete your model fill it with a little happy town this small model shows how Rivers cut their course to the ocean by following the lowest point try to design your town and the layout of the ground so the river goes around the buildings I'll see you later I'm going to take a swim in the river now there are lots of ways to experiment change the amount of water or the steepness of the angle look at the soil it's all getting eroded over here or the way the town is laid out every time you do it the river goes in a different direction and have fun oh pH I'm I'm tired I'm just going to lie down and that is the power of water Bern's theorem states that faster moving air has lower pressure than slower moving air you can demonstrate this yourself with a pingpong ball and a hair dryer you put the pingpong ball on the stream of air from the hair dryer and because it's moving quickly it has lower pressure than the air around it so the low pressure air Works sort of like a force field and you can defy gravity with your floating pingpong ball awesome but of course this is science Max experiments at large so we have to Max it out with a giant haird dryer and a giant pingpong [Music] ball it I sorry I said science you probably couldn't hear me because of the foam foam foam how can they all be foam well foam usually means something to do with bubbles there's all kinds of solid Foams out there and they can be squishy or not squishy they're usually light air is an insulator that means it does not conduct heat or cold very well you see I cannot tell this ice is cold until I get my finger really close to it yeah yeah there it is uhhuh there I feel it and because foam is full of air bubbles it makes a great insulator that's why we make coolers out of foam so what's the best most advanced foam out there it's this it's called aerogel and it's 98.2% air it is super light because it's mostly air and it's a great insulator because it's mostly air it's great to pack things in as well and Nasa uses it on the Mars rover and in space suits because it's such a good insulator cool or not cool because you know it's an insulator so it would protect from the cool as you may have already guessed today is about friction and here's a really easy friction experiment you can do at home all you need is a piece of wood you don't need the frame and you don't have to uh do anything fancy to it just put one end up on a couch or a coffee table and make a nice ramp then you want something to slide down that ramp and I like to use a piece of wood now check it out wood ramp wood block the friction is so much that the wood slides to there now what I like to do is take a little flag and mark the results recording the results is good science now here's where it gets fun get another surface and attach it to the wood like carpet and wood let's see how far this goes H not as good all right record the results cardboard ooh nicely done cardboard [Music] foam and this wood has has been waxed like on a floor wax which makes it nice and slippery let's see how that does oo and now the Ultimate Ice attached to Wood this is actually harder to do than I thought all right let's try it out ice the clear winner not a big surprise right there and get this once you've done all of that you can change the surface of the ramp you can go to waxwood carpet boom cardboard well and and well yeah you get the idea record all the results compare them and there you go friction ramp experiment and that's what we're going to be maxing out today so come on let's go I'm an acid and I'm a base and we are enemies well we're not really enemies yeah that's true it's all about how we react react chemically you see as an acid I really want to give protons away protons who needs your protons get your protons here protons I got more than I want I don't need them anymore and bases we need protons we'll do anything to get them protons you can protons away I'll take some I'll take some protons you think that when you get these two together you'd have some pretty great chemistry but the truth is when they're together they often don't react that is until water gets involved once you have water acids and bases react here take some protons all your base are belong to us there you go take some protons I don't need more I want more I want moreon water is a solvent allowing the chemical reactions to take place depending on the strength of the acids and bases that reaction can be mild would you like a proton oh no really I could please please take it oh well thank you that's very generous have another no perhaps maybe I will okay maybe just one but if the acids and bases are strong the chemical reaction can be really extreme this is what's going on in the ant acid tablet and why without water nothing happens oh water water come what did you do here's another small experiment you can do with inertia take a stack of checkers or game pieces like I have here oh or coins coins work really well and a ruler or something else that's full flat this is the kind of stick they give you at the hardware store to stir your paint with now you can knock Checkers out of the middle of the stack without the stack falling over if you're very careful you see the friction of the checkers leaving the middle of the stack won't be enough to overcome the inertia of the rest of the checkers ready now let's Max it out oh I have these pizza boxes and they should work the same way you see you get a stack and don't worry I've already eaten all the pizza and I put him on there like that and now I need a ruler and what I've got is this Cricut bat you see it's got a nice flat Edge just like the ruler now if this works right I can hit it hard enough to knock out just one or two pizza boxes and the rest of the stack should stay here we go ready science awesome and there you have it Newton's first law an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion an object in motion tends to stay in motion usually there's a sign that kind of here's a fun experiment you can try if you have something heavy like this glass of water water and you put it on a piece of paper you can experiment with inertia if you move the paper slowly the glass moves with the paper because the friction between the paper and the glass is enough to overcome the inertia of the glass but if you move the paper quickly the friction is not enough to overcome the inertia and the glass stays put and now let's Max it out okay let's do it all right now you might be tempted to try this at home and you can but please for me promise that you'll let an adult know you're about to do this and don't don't use breakable plates use plastic plates because this will take a couple times of practicing before you get it right put something on the plastic plates because the heavier they are the better it will work all right did I mention not to do this at home unless an adult knows your doing it I cannot stress that enough okay deal all right deal here we [Music] go and there you go Newton's first law thank you all sound is vibration but it's really hard to it's really hard to learn about the that vibration if you can't see it I mean sound is invisible right well here's a way that you can make sound visible all you need is some plastic wrap and salt and a bowl just a regular bowl and an elastic like this so what you do is you take the plastic wrap and cut off a piece just large enough to fit over the bowl and then use the elastic to wrap around the bowl to keep the plastic tight pour some salt on the bowl and then watch this hello vibrating s the plastic wrap is stretched tight over the bowl making it like a drum a drum that's very sensitive to sound vibrations your ear works the same way that's why we call it an ear drum the vibrations for my voice make the plastic wrap vibrate and that makes the salt dance but there's more let's Max this out this is a cadney plate and what it is is just a piece of metal on a platform that vibrates up and down to a frequency which I can program with this dial here and when the sound waves vibrate the plate they can interact in ways that make the sand form interesting patterns take a look The Sounds I'm generating vibrate the plate make it move like a wave but when the vibrations reach the edge of the plate they bounce back and interact with the other waves going the other way the way these waves interact at different notes is what causes the sand to make these different shapes so this is great but you know what we can Max it out even more maxing it out even [Music] more okay that's about as much as I can take of that mouse trap um like I said we are going to be using Mouse straps Mouse trps as a form of propulsion that's the force that makes things go and we are going to be making a boat go and what is the thing that's going to make this boat go a mouse oh oh it's not set sorry I'm really jumpy anyway we're going to be using a mouse trap and don't worry no mice are going to be harmed in the making of this or any science Max episode but mouse traps are really great because they can store energy in the spring if you see there's a spring that makes this bar want to snap back but we can put energy into the spring and store it and then use that energy as it unwinds the spring to propel our butt but it's a little more complicated than just this so come on I'll show you what we're going to do is build this this is the mouse trap boat and it works like this I've got the mouse strap and it's attached to a long arm that arm has a string on it and it goes around the Paddle Wheel and as the mous Trap unwinds the Paddle Wheel spins like that which pushes the boat forward now looks kind of complicated but it's actually quite simple to make and here's what you need my mouse trap boat is made with styrofoam craft sticks and elastics you'll also want a pencil plastic drink caps a shish kebab skewer small zip ties string and of course your mouse strap now Mouse straps can hurt your fingers so get an adult to help you when you use them start with two pieces of Styrofoam I like to cut mine into this shape but the only really important thing is that they're the same size your Paddle Wheel is made from a circle of Styrofoam with a penciled through the middle and it will go across like this to make the Paddle Wheel I use cut pieces of craft stick or they can be plastic and make some cut and then put them in like this and that is what will make your paddles on the Paddle Wheel cuz that's the wheel and that's the paddle Paddle Wheel that's why they call it that stick drink caps to the ends of the pencil after sticking it through the styrofoam I like to use a few craft sticks and elastics to help give the styrofoam strength next is the mouse trap which you want to glue down to a frame of four craft sticks attach the frame to the boat with elastics then attach the shishkabob skewer or a pencil to the mouse trap with z zip ties I like to put some craft sticks on the end to make it easier to tie the string to it wrap the other end around the Paddle Wheel pencil and remember you need enough string so that your stick can lie flat okay let's try it out wind up the Paddle Wheel this will be a little hard as the spring will pull back but that's where you're storing the energy and when it's wound up put it in the water and let it go paddle wheel turns because the mouse trap is transferring energy that we put in earlier and it goes all the way we stored the energy in the tension of the spring now that tension is pulling the mouse trap the stick and the string which turns the Paddle Wheel and makes the boat go mous trp powered boat if you want more detailed instructions or other designs look up mous trp boat and there you have it the mous Trap powered Paddle Wheel boat and this is what we're going to max out today come on greetings science Max mites my name is Phil and it's moving day today on science Max experiment at large let's see where do I put this um this is probably a good spot today we are moving air you probably don't think that moving air will have a huge effect but you'd be surprised what you can do by just moving air but don't worry we're not just going to move the air around in boxes we are going to build a rocket and this rocket uses the science of stomping on something with your foot this is a Stomp Rocket and it works by stomping on this plastic bottle and air shoots through this tube and pushes the rocket up into the sky and here is how you can build one of your very own and remember if I go too fast don't worry all of the steps are on the website so you can follow along at your own speed all you need is a 2 L plastic bottle three kinds of tape electrical tape duct tape and science tape science tape is just the same as in visible tape but I use this kind of tapee for science then you want some plumbers tubing and some construction paper to make your actual rocket first you want to take your plumbers tubing and cut it into three lengths and when I say you I mean an adult because you need to use a saw so you saw it up into a long piece a short piece and an elbow piece we want to make a long tube at the top and then we also want to make a tube at the bottom so we can attach our 2 L bottle to and there we go ta-da ready to go but of course it doesn't stay up so we have to attach it to a base and it will look like this and you see it's been attached with duct tape here and I've used electrical tape and I wrapped that part around there now building the rocket wrap the paper around the tube and tape it with your science tape tape the top clothes so no air escapes then cut a semicircle to make the nose cone and three Hoops for thrusters and tape them to the bottom there you go the rocket fits on the tube just like that and when you stomp on this bottle it launches but here's the most important part the one most important rule of launching Rockets you shoot Rockets outside come on once you get outside to a nice open area and you bring your safety glasses with you all you need to do to make the Stomp Rocket work is of course stomp on it you ready here we go 3 2 1 W you see that that was amazing hey science Maxim mites I slippery but that's okay because today we're talking about friction friction is a force that is everywhere and happens when any one thing rubs against any other thing we do lots of things to increase friction like uh like wear shoes with big treads on them and we can do things to reduce friction like the experiment we're doing today we're going to build a hover dis and it's very easy you take some cardboard and cut it into a circle just like this then put a hole in the middle of the circle you might want an adult to help you with that and then take a plastic drink bottle cap like this I like the ones use the ones that uh you get on sport bottles because because they have a little nozzle that pops open or closed and then you glue it around the circle and you get this then you need a balloon so you blow up your balloon I know you know that step and then twist the balloon so it doesn't get away from you when it's nice and twisted you can stick it over the drink bottle cap like this and then under twist it and this is why I like to use the plastic drink bottle caps that come from sport bottles because you can open it when you want and when you do your disc rides on a cushion of air reducing the friction with the table and it's almost like it's sliding on Ice you can also use CDs if you want to do a different design just make sure you're using CDs you never want to listen to again now if any of this is too fast don't worry you can always go to the science Max webbsite where we have all of the instructions this is water now it's ice water science okay no that's not the science part here's something you can do at home get some ice water and a way to time yourself and stick your hand in the ice water it's a little hard to stick your hand in ice water for a long period of time because after a while it starts to hurt but don't worry the pain that you're feeling isn't actually because you're damaging anything it's just your body's way to tell you that you need to take your hand out of the cold water yeah you usually can't do it for very long but some animals like seals and whales they live in ice water all the time they live in the Arctic so how do they do it one word blubber blubber is a layer of fat that protects you from the coal or protects the seal in a whale we don't have blubber but we are today going to have some blubber cuz we're going to make a blubber glove blubber glove I love saying that here's how we do it first we want blubber okay this isn't blubber this is lard which is actually animal fat you can use lard you can use margarine or butter or shortening anything with a lot of fat in it and remember this is messy so definitely get an adult to help you so we've got our lard and we need a bag so what you're going to do is you're going to take a scoop full of lard like this and I'm going to put it in the bag like so mhm like that there we go and then you're going to start smoothing out the blubber or the lard like this because what you want to do is have a nice thin layer all the way around see starting to work yeah yeah then seal the bag and tape the edges ah a square of blubber then do it again here I have two bags of blubber and I've taped all the way around the outside so I have a blubber glove check it out so let's try it out I stick the blubber glove in the ice water it's completely working it is not even cold the blubber is completely protecting my hand from the Ice Water I'm not even remotely cold at all that is very fun so try it yourself a blubber glove now how do we max out a blubber glove watch water ice water I know for a fact that I wouldn't last more than 10 seconds in here without my blubber suit I'm going to make an entire outfit of blubber I've got them in large plastic bags and I'm going to get completely suited up in blubber with the help of Trevor and Stephanie okay guys suit me up it's very heavy let's just go like this oh okay time to cut back on the cookies all right let's do it all right lover suit go I can't okay okay here we [Music] go okay so far oh my legs are warm oh Flubber suit ha I am in sealed actually here I am in the in the ice and I don't feel too bad buber suit Works FL suits refreshing actually you you just sit back and chill out well there you go FL suit success seals and whales are able to stay in ice water for their whole lives because they have protective layers of blubber just like I do okay so now all I have to do is get out blubber suit oh no my blubber is leaking ah I've sprung a leak my blubber oh my precious blubber no what a world today we're combining two different chemicals to create a reaction sometimes chemicals can combine in a way that makes them very different from how they started out for example this is sodium or na on the period periodic table now the sodium tablets are in mineral oil because sodium reacts very strongly with water even the water in the air or especially the water in my skin watch what happens when I drop a sodium tablet into this Beaker of water very cool and very dangerous and this is chlorine or CL on the periodic table chlorine gas is very poisonous so so what happens if we combine these two deadly substances do we create some sort of super poison something more deadly than anything else known to science that causes fear and chaos and chemistry Labs all over the land no we create salt good old normal table salt these two substances combined to make n salt something completely and totally safe cover here dear Phil I can't believe you did a whole episode on boat propulsion and you didn't use the greatest thing out there for making a boat move a propeller sincerely a fan well let's talk about propellers oh good thing this is fan mail get it cuz it's a fan anyway a fan pushes air just like a boat propeller pushes water they're both fluids and they behave in the same way now if you look closely at a fan it's curved on the blades the air or water is caught under at this side and then it's pushed out on the curve to make it go that way and the faster it spins the better it works now this is a propeller powered boat and what you do is wind up the propeller I have an elastic band here to store the amount of energy I put in and then you put it in the water the propeller spins and the boat goes forwards it's being propelled by the propeller that's why you call it that this is a pendulum it's a weight let's swing it swings back and forth pendulums are pretty simple it it swings back and forth predicting the path of a pendulum pretty simple just going to swing back and forth but wait as I make it so much more complex by adding a pendulum now I've got a pendulum down here and that one swings back and forth and I've got a pendulum up here that swings back and forth what will happen to this part of the pendulum when I let it go can you predict let's find out this is a double pendulum and predicting the path of a double pendulum is really difficult it's still simple physics but because there's a moving part attached to a moving part it makes it way more complex so the question is can we Max it out even more of course we can these are chaos pendulums this one's a lever and it's got another lever on the end whoa and this one here is a perfectly balanced lever and it's got a pendulum on either side scientists and Engineers have always said that the more moving part something has the more complex they are science this is a balloon and this is an orange when you put them together a chemical reaction happens ah how'd you go in there for a minute didn't I hit no no all right well you can actually do a chemical reaction between a balloon and an orange you see balloons are made of latex which is a kind of polymer that's very very stretchy and orange peels contain a chemical called lioning loning breaks down [Music] latex so we have three questions the first is why does this happen well like I said it's all chemistry you see balloons are made of polymers chains of molecules held together by chemical bonds a limine molecule attacks those bonds delicious and breaks it that separates the polymers and that pops the balloon but remember it only works with natural latex so make sure you're using natural latex balloons second question why do they call it loning when it's in orange peels I mean yes it's in Lime Peels and lemon peels but the chemical itself smells like oranges they should call it orine or or Citrus fride or anyway third question should we Max it out of course we should come on 200 balloons versus two bottles of limonene ready go science the shape of something makes a big difference in how strong it is get some toilet paper rolls and put them in a square and then stack books on top of them they can hold weight thing is they can actually hold a lot more weight than you probably think in fact the amount of weight just paper in a tube can hold is really kind of [Music] impressive and now let's Max it out Sarah and I are looking at different recipes for slime all right what do we got here so over here we have some amazing foamy slime which has so so many ingredients in it here watch what happens when we start pulling it out oo wow so it's like super stretchy and super fluffy here that's great okay now we got to you got to hold yours you got to hold this in okay you take and then take some more and then we take that and yeah it gets thinner and thinner and it becomes more and more lines of foamies slime yeah and the last kind of slime we made today is some classic Flubber slime so much fun now why you think it's called is flubber slime because it's is it really a slime it is a slime yeah it's super fun and it's super stretchy oh okay I get it look look at that and it's sort of like like a little bit like gelatin it is almost like gelatin here you can have some there you go all right so Sarah now what we need to decide mhm is how we're going to Max it out right like should we just get a lot of slime that sounds like a really good idea but we are going to need something to put it in cuz we can't just have slime all over the floor okay you're right so we'll get we'll get some sort of container thing yeah and we'll see how much slime we can make and then we'll just play with it and see what happens sounds good and yeah we will experiment CU it's science yeah okay high high five careful high five so we don't splatter okay good okay let's go this oh greetings science maxit my name is Phil and I think I might have overdone it with the science I mean what's a better use of science than creating a whole bunch of slime well I did and you know what it's really cool slime I love slime it always makes me feel like a mad scientist but I need a good mad scientist laugh yeah it needs work anyway today we are talking about polymers polymers like slime but you see polymer polymers aren't really a substance they're more how something is constructed and there's all kinds of different polymers there's slime obviously and rubber polymers like well like rubber and there's also hard polymers like plastic now polymers are all kind of constructed the same way like this this is a chain yeah so imagine this is a chain of molecules and all the molecules are the same and they just repeat in a long line now when you get a polymer like slime all the chains are not connected or very Loosely connected which means that they can flow over each other like a slime or sort of like a liquid and they behave like that so that is slime but when you get to a rubber polymer you start to get little Bonds in between the chains of polymers that work like this you see they still move around a little bit but they can they can spread apart and they become flexible and bouncy yeah I know a chain a chain doesn't really bounce but rubber polymers do huh now when it gets to a solid polymer like plastic there's a lot more links and it's all kind of interconnected and it doesn't move at all it doesn't move okay again harder to tell with a chain but plastic is very hard and rigid so let's dive into the world of polymers and make some slime H yeah too mad not enough scientist I'll keep working on it anyway to make slime take your white glue and pour in uh an amount it really kind of depends on how much slime you want to make now you want to add about twice as much water as that uh somewhere around there great now we want to put in just a little bit of soap M maybe there that's good and you want to put in your food coloring I like green green seems like the right slime color to me it's the right appropriate mad scientist kind of slime and then you want to start mixing that up till you get the right kind of consistency that means make sure the glue and the water are equally mixed up good and now we're ready to make it an actual Slime by bonding the polymers together by adding liquid starch mhm very good and you want to mix it up when you add the liquid starch it starts to Bond the chains of molecules together changing it from a liquid to a slime it's coming along and there you go slime now if you want clear slime and not opaque slime you want to use clear glue and not white glue but that's basically the recipe so there you go slime to super villain yeah okay well anyway we all right oh this is a prince Rupert's drop it's a piece of glass that has a long snaky tail and a bulb at one end so what's so interesting about a glass tadpole well I'll show you and remember this is just glass oh Prince Rupert's drops are very strong almost as strong as steel it's all in how they're made molten glass is dropped into cold water what happens is the outer part of the drop cools off first leaving the inner part still hot when the inner part eventually cools it contracts pulling everything in Tighter and Tighter keeping it under a lot of tension and because it's round the force you put on it is distributed all the way around just like the force is distributed on an arched Bridge until you get to the tail just the tiniest break in the tail and it explodes all that energy is released in a chain reaction why it's so strong you can hammer on one end but explodes when you break the other puzzled scientists for centuries but now we know it's all in how it's made the Wizard Academy all you have to do is demonstrate great true magic and you'll be granted entry send in the next applicant okay don't let them see you don't let them see you okay Magic Smoke and here we go big entrance behold it is I overwhelm you again I only have to demonstrate magic one time and you have to let me into the Wizard Academy and last last time does not count so prepare for your mind to be boggled and your eyes to also be boggled because I shall do a trick I will just get to it here is a book Behold and now Feast your stupefaction as I produce another book ha and then two or three more times behold as I put as I that's good behold and now look upon the wonderment as I stack these books on top of each other like this and now Feast more stupefaction as I I cleverly move the books off the table and now now comes the magic W now I say the magic word the magic word and behold the book is levitating it is completely off the table I have done it magic no no not magic that's science but the book is levitating no look at it's not even touching the table no it's being supported by the books below because of the center of mass Preposterous I'm afraid it's very posterous each book is balanced on the one below in a way that the center of mass is behind the edge of the book below and the entire stack Center of mass is behind the edge of the table so it may look like magic but it's science so I can't get into the Wizard Academy no I'm afraid not I good Alakazam you will rule the day that overwhelm mod did not I will return and then you will see oh ow this is an egg eggs do not like to be [Music] dropped oh fortunately we can use the power of science to design find something that'll keep the egg safe as it falls behold my egg drop Contraptions the thing I really like about this experiment is there's no wrong way to do this you can come up with any design you want and see if it works this one here is a bunch of helium balloons this structure is just to keep the helium balloons on so the egg can touch down very gently here it goes who and and the egg is unharmed miraculously sound that one worked really well success this is a giant helium balloon that I think will work pretty much the same way because I think this balloon will drop just slowly enough that the egg can actually just touch and nothing will happen um so that didn't work and then there's this one which has no slowing at all it's all designed to just absorb the impact and the idea is that the cone will crumple and absorb the force when it hits the bottom oh no no I think it would have worked if it hadn't turned in the air but it did and well I guess the egg is completely broken so I'd call that one a fail this one is the parachute you see the egg has been nestled into this foam container and this is a parachute that will hopefully slow the egg down woohoo uh-oh whoa over over good and that one seemed to work well yep the egg is totally fine the parachute worked all right egg drop experiment totally fun experiment to do but the question is how do we Max it out and the answer is pumpkin drop same thing except with a pumpkin instead of an egg come on okay all right pumpkin drop with everything attached all at once okay here we go ready one two [Music] three so what we've learned from this is the heavier something is the more force is acting on it from Gravity which means the harder it is to slow down when it's falling okay fair enough you win this one gravity but I'll beat you next time I'm I'm going to get a broom moving air is a lot of fun especially if you use one of these a Vortex Cannon they're pretty impressive and they use some pretty amazing science I'll show you how to build one it's pretty simple all you need is a plastic cup you want a balloon something round AN elastic scissors or a craft knife and a pen here's what you do take your balloon and cut it just where it gets wide you take the mouth of the cup right there and you have to stretch the balloon over the top and then you want to put an elastic around it keep it in place and this now is a surface on the top and that's what you're going to use to pull back and create your burst of air but of course the air is not going to go anywhere until you make a hole in the bottom so here's what you do you take your round thing and draw a circle and take your craft knife or scissors and an adult and get them to help you cut out a hole and when you pull back on the balloon a burst of air comes through the hole but the air has an interesting shape now I know what you're thinking you're thinking Phil air is invisible you can't tell what shape it is well I can show you come on this is my maxed out Vortex Cannon it's made out of a garbage can I've got a hole in here and this is a shower curtain with a ball that I can get a grip on and Pull and then it shoots forward like this now it makes a big puff of air but again the air is invisible so we don't know what shape it is but I can help with that because I've got this a fog machine I fill the inside of the garbage can so we can see what the air is doing when I fire The Vortex can okay come on over here ready whoa okay ready check it out the vortex Cannon shapes the air into a ring called a Vortex it makes a ring well actually sort of a donut because of its shape the air in a Vortex can move much farther than air that doesn't have a shape [Applause] Vortex Cannon air that has a shape goes a lot further than air that doesn't have a shape and it's also way more fun woohoo okay so where were we oh yeah 3 2 1 yeah and remember don't try this at home slime Sarah and I enjoyed our maxed out tub of slime so let's recap slime is made of polymers polymers come in a lot of different forms it's all about long chains of molecules and none are more fun to swim in than slime do I have slime here oo yeah definitely slime [Applause] here slime [Music] [Applause] well there you go science Max experiments at large polymers slime yeah high fives slimy H five this is a rubber glove well actually it's a latex glove what's the difference I will get to that in a second but I'm sure you can agree it's super stretchy how stretchy let's fill a rubber glove with water and see how big it gets so difference between latex and rubber well it all comes from a rubber tree well actually it's a fake tree just to show you how it works the sap of the rubber tree is collected just like this there's a spigot and then the sap goes out and it's collected it's the same way that the sap for maple syrup is collected and this this is natural latex if it's dried out it becomes natural rubber latex generally means the liquid form and rubber means the solid form but wait then why is this a latex glove the glove is not liquid what's the deal well generally latex means water-based or liquid like latex paint but it could also mean synthetic latex that's latex that's man-made and doesn't come from a rubber tree so we call rubber gloves rubber gloves cuz they used to come from rubber trees but now they're usually made out of man-made latex but either way they're super stretchy I wonder how big this is going to [Music] [Music] get science here is an experiment you can do at home with friction this is a toy boat yes you guessed that right and this is a wooden plank correct that's two for two I put the boat on the ramp and Watch What Happens nothing the reason why is because the friction between the boat and the ramp is enough to counteract the force of gravity trying to pull it down but watch what happens if I raise the ramp to the right height the boat slides down because the friction isn't enough and gravity pulls it down but when we change surfaces to this carpet let's see what happens same angle I can raise it higher higher higher because there's more friction between the carpet and the boat than there was between the wood and the boat our pastor Bridge was going to take a long time to build out of individual pieces so we have a new plan hey Michaela hey Phil how you doing I'm great how are you good this is Michaela she's an undergrad in industrial engineering right I am and you and Kyle have a new plan for how we can build our pasta Bridge that's not going to look like this oh man this is the best that KY and I could do with 20 minutes okay well I have better good I'm glad how are we going to do it so instead of that we're going to try something like this oh okay this is sort of like a giant burrito kind of thing right yep but we're going to build the bridge out of this exactly uh we going to make it longer though yep we're going to make it 8 ft long we have this long Pole right Y and we have sheets of this pasta we're going to put them on the diagonal okay and we're going to roll it but we're going to start from this corner and we're going to keep rolling and don't forget to add water and we got to add water I'll add the water okay adding water just like this yep helps the Passa to stick together so as we're rolling we're rolling we're rolling we're going to keep doing this with a bunch more sheets so that it gets really really long like 8 ft long and when we're finally done rolling we got to spray it with some varnish yep and so it all holds together great and then it's going to be about this thing yeah when we're finished with it exactly this is going to be one of the parts the deck of our Bridge great so each one of these large pieces is going to be like one single strand of pasta in the little Bridge we yeah we need a lot of these a lot a lot still it's a lot faster than doing it piece by piece with just spetti every time I hold it up you make that noise a a [Laughter] a awesome now we're going to talk about tension what's tension one more than nin get it tension and nine this okay I'll um cuz tension is the force that we usually talk about when we think about pulling a rope or a chain or something like that because you know the old expression you can't push a rope but today we are going to push a rope I have a rope right here and I'm going to push it using another Force called flexion I've got some pieces of plastic here and they Bend or Flex and when they do they want to spring back but I'm going to prevent them from springing back by putting them in between these knots huh and look the Rope now stays up I take another piece and I stick it on this knot and then I bend it all the way this is not terrifying really it's not terrifying at all okay good and then I take this piece and I put it here and I bend it around and so now we have a rope that's being pushed and we're Defying Gravity and we're making a cool art sculpture all right one more here okay here we go and and flexing and ha there you go I've pushed a rope defied gravity and made a cool art sculpture okay well I guess technically I haven't really pushed the Rope because we're still pulling from each knot and I guess I haven't really defied gravity cuz that one's sitting on the table and all the others are sitting on top of that but you can't argue that I made a cool art sculpture art I mean science Bill's weight on two toilet paper rolls nope Bill's weight on four toilet paper rolls nope Bill's weight on six toilet paper rolls nope bills weight on 10 toilet paper rolls ha Phil's weight can be supported by 10 toilet paper rolls but what if Phil jumps didn't really work this this is a bike tire it's pretty light but I still can't hold it from the end of the pole like this with one hand nope nope but I can if I get it spinning fast enough I just use this drill and then I get okay so this is going to be awfully hard to do with one person uh oh this is the perfect opportunity to use the Trevor button Trevor button hey Trevor from the science Max build team what are you doing maxing this out oh right on can you give me give me a hand for a second sure awesome okay so you take this this drill and we're going to get this wheel spinning really fast okay I don't know if it's um no no I don't want to know I don't know if I remembered to no it's fine Max it out we got to Max it out so because it's spinning I can hold this heavy weight in the air how is this possible because the wheel is is basically a top the forces that prevent a top tipping angular momentum are still working here this angular momentum resists a change in Direction This Way which is how gravity would want it to tip interestingly these same forces also keep it spinning around me in a circle so I can lift a heavy weight in the air just by spinning it awesome Max Head experiment Trevor yeah what was that it's my science confetti high five I just made you know what we should do what we should Max it out yeah we can make a giant one and then a whole bunch of confetti in it and then people like jump up and more confetti that would come out right and then so what would happen is there would be all this Trevor okay science maxit prepare to Heart through the cosmos I am Captain Phil and today we're going to be building rockets on science Max now we've we've built Rockets before like this one powered by air pressure and this one stomp Rockets which were also technically powered by air pressure air pressure rocket but today science maximite we are going to be building Rockets powered by chemistry chemical powered Rockets away okay I promise it'll be more exciting than that because today science maximite we are going to be looking at chemistry chemistry is when two molecules combine to make another molecule like magic oo so let's take a look at what will be powering our chemical rocket this it's an ant acid tablet when you put an ant acid tablet in water it makes little bubbles of carbon dioxide gas this happens because of a reaction between two kinds of molecules called acids and bases like vinegar and baking soda but all contained in a small package that won't start working until you put it in water if we contain the reaction the carbon dioxide gas builds up and creates pressure high five for science all right so let's look at our chemical powered rocket what you need is one of these this is a this is is a film canister and ask your parents what that actually means because they're not used for holding film anymore you can get these at craft stores though to whole paint or little things but really all you need is a plastic container with a good lid that snaps on nice and tight and keeps the air in and then of course what you need are your ant acid tablets and a little bit of water so pour in some water and then put in your ant acid tablet and snap the lid on flip it over and wait for the car carbon dioxide gas to build up which will build up pressure which will launch your rocket so there you go a chemical powered rocket 100 different kinds of slime yes it's going to be so much fun but we're not going to make a 100 today yeah I know we're just going to do our top favorites yeah it's going to be super great all right what are we starting with so our first slime we're starting with today is some really cool molding slime now this slime actually if you leave it out overnight it'll Harden and you can make an imprint of whatever you like so here we made an imprint of our little uh tool there so we're going to look at a little bit more liquidy slime starting with this one over here which I believe you already know about this is cornstarch mud exactly you hold this sound good I'm going to hold this I'm going to try pouring it oh oh so see it's like it's like a liquid then you do it faster it's like a solid all right what's next over here we have some other really awesome types of slime so right over here we have some crunchy slime crunchy slime exactly why is it crunchy now it's crunchy cuzz we've actually added a few beads inside of it to make it crunchy this is some really cool awesome slime take you can feel the beads as you get stretch it out it's so cool this is what this one is a little harder to clean exactly I'll just do that all right so what's next so next we have some really cool glow-in-the-dark slime glow-in-the-dark slime yeah it's so awesome look at how much it glows that glows a lot that's super super glowy slime so to do the different kinds of slime we need the polymer yes and then the thing that sticks the polymers togetherly so the glue is the polymer glue is the polymer and the starch is the thing that bonds it yes aha very Co and then you put the thing in that makes it the the kind of slime yes right before you add the bonding component because if we keep uh adding stuff after it's already made it unfortunately won't be able to take it so we add our powder before we add our starch in this situation uh should we go on to the next thing yeah let's move on with more slime Sarah and I are maxing out polymer slime how maxed out tub of slime whoa okay so how do you feel is it are we mixed up enough first we mix up a bunch of slime in a garbage bin so with the polymer chemistry the polymer is generally a liquid right Y and the bonding agent makes it stick together so the more we use the more of a solid we get exactly so we want to split it and make it sort of halfway between a liquid and a solid and I think we're exactly at the right stage it looks perfect oh yeah okay so let's dump this garbage can in all right all right then we dump it in so gross it turns out we needed more slime um I don't think that's going to be enough I think we may need some more slime yeah how much more do you think we need so we added 11 more ah delicious last one last one oh yeah then we experimented oh oh yeah we have a giant giant tub of slime because the Slime is stretchy it creates Creed amazing bubbles so do you think I could blow a bubble with the Slime well maybe not you but definitely air compressor no either no i' have to just put it on my face I think I've already got it on my face then there was only one thing left to do we get in this slime can we do that we can totally do that this a science Mach That's so exciting goinging swimming in slimes who's going first you are I am obviously all right this is how science Max does poers 3 2 one this is a basketball it bounces this is a golf ball it bounces but it never bounces as high as where I dropped it from but watch as I put the golf ball on top of the basketball whoa why does the golf ball bounce higher than where I dropped it from how is this possible I only bounc the golf ball from 1 M high so what's going on well as the basketball hits the ground it compresses storing the potential energy of its bounce about to give that energy back as it bounces up again but this energy works as a springboard for the golf ball and since the golf ball has a lot less mass than the basketball the upwards kinetic energy of the basketball is given to the golf ball so let's Max it out ball on a ball ball on a ball three ball [Music] bounce did you see that ball on a ball on a ball on a ball quadruple ball bounce [Music] don't wait turns out getting four balls to drop straight down on top of each other is pretty difficult so we know the mass of the ball is important why don't we Max it out in a different way this is a Swiss ball for exercising it has a lot more mass than a golf ball so let's try it out there you go the transfer of energy between balls a great way to lose golf balls plastic is great and plastic is everywhere but the problem with plastic is it isn't very biodegradable it it doesn't break down in the environment I'm still on hold oh well there you go back for another couple years I guess but here's a way that you can make bioplastic it's fully biodegradable because it's made of natural materials the recipe is easy two parts corn starch three parts water a few drops of cooking oil and some food coloring to make it whatever color you want purple science purple mix it up and it turns into a paste now what you'll need are two things one an adult and two a microwave put it in for 30 seconds clock wipe there we go then take it out and mix it some more until it cools down then you can pull it out and use your hands to sculpt it into a shape or take the shape of something else once you put it all the way around you can turn it into a little flower pot once you've sculpted it you need to wait for it to dry which will take about a day clock wipe after waiting a day huh what it's been a day oh you have something made out of bioplastic like this little flower pot you can use to grow a small plant and then when it grows big enough you can take this biodegradable flower pot and plant it right outside in the dirt and this pot will biodegrade and turn back into dirt pretty cool right well let's Max it out biodegradable frisbee check it out it's a frisbee but it's biodegradable so you throw it around in the Park but if you lose it it turns back into dirt what not enough okay clock wipe spod degradable lawn chair use it for one season and then return it to the Earth afterwards I think this is one of my best science Max okay bioplastic lawn chair not as strong as regular lawn chair we've learned that lesson now so that's that's good to know I mean I mean how would I have known if I hadn't tried it"

        "transcription": "this is science facts experiments at harsh [Music] hey welcome to science Max experiments at large I'm Phil mccordigan and hold on a second I'm just gonna change okay that's better now uh where were we all right let's go make a boat so you know that some things float and some things sick like rocks or wood or uh full water bottles and empty water bottles or uh carrots foam waffles screwdriver playing cards plasticine tin foil potato my watch hmm wait that wasn't that wasn't supposed to go in there so how oh so how do you make a boat you make it out of something that floats right well most boats are actually made out of metal tin foil is metal and well it sinks but if you fold tin foil into a boat shape it floats and boats don't only float themselves but they can hold people in Cargo in fact there's container ships crossing the ocean at this very moment that are holding thousands of tons of cargo and they're all made of metal which doesn't float it sinks so how do boats do it are they magic no of course not boats are science and here you can be science maximites get some tin foil and cut it into the same size pieces and fold a couple different shapes of boats and see which one can hold the most weight before sinking now it's time to Max it out but before we do here's how you can fold your own tinfoil boat in less than 15 seconds first take a square piece of tin foil then fold it in half fold one corner down and the other Corner down then open it up and ta-da you're done if you want instructions on how to fold a more complicated boat go to our website I have a feeling I'm gonna need a few extra lab coats for this experiment like I was saying let's max out the tin foil boat and find out a little bit more about why boats float no [Applause] oh okay well I'm I'm here at an indoor pool um which is not uh I wasn't expecting to be in the pool just yet but this is where we're gonna build our giant tin foil boat so why not hey who's there oh no you're wet I yeah I thought I was gonna come in over there but I I came in on the water slide I think I had the coordinates wrong anyway this is Lucia and she's from let's talk science which is all about Science Education right yes just like us so you're gonna help me max out the tin foil boat I think I dropped it in the water hold on the tin foil boat Phil this is a boat well it looked a lot better before I came down the water slide but that's the idea and then we make it bigger what do you think I don't think it's gonna work but well why not Temple is very thin and it might not hold the shape of the boat well I still think we should use tin foil though why well because the small experiment with tin foil and I bought all of this tinfoil then let's do it tin foil okay high five I will um I'll take the same foil and you take that and um I'm gonna have to dry off at some point welcome to shipbuilding for pirates oh I'm swabby and I've built some of the finest pirate ships for some of the finest Pirates this side of the Caribbean and I can teach you to do the same but first you need to know your Basics mass and volume let's start with volume but not that kind of volume which of these two chests do you think has more volume right this one here which of these two balloons do you think has more volume right this one here volume is how much space something takes up which of these two chests has more volume that's right they're the same but which of these two chests has more mass which is heavier hmm hard to tell isn't it but what if I told you that this one was empty and this one was full of treasure loonies now which one has more mass that's right this one these two chests have the same volume but this one has more mass this chest has more volume than that one but this one my loonies that just does not have as much mass volume is how much space something takes up and mass is how heavy something is and when you look at them both together you're looking at density join us next time on shipbuilding for pirates then we'll look at how volume mass and density work together to make something float oh my precious precious loonies are you all right my pretties they can't talk so I'm not sure what they're saying so who's near and I get to work constructing a large tinfoil boat our first design is just sort of a square bolded together out of a very large sheet of tin foil simple but can I ride in it there we go a Giants tinfoil folks just my size I don't know if it's gonna work but it's too thin you think it's too thin I feel like this what should we do do you want to test it let's test it okay good idea so here's here's the most important question do you want to test it or should I test it no no you test it all right here we go putting it in first test does it float on its own yeah floats on its own no problem if I just get in very carefully then it will work fine see if I if I'm if I'm careful about how I get in no it's fine see if I just get in like that are you okay wait a minute wait a minute it sort of it's sort of no that's just air you don't want to run it wasn't boat shaped I think if we make it look more like a canoe because canoes float if we make it look like a canoe it'll work great no no no we need some support if we add a couple of structures in between then we add support to it I'll tell you what let's make a boat like I want to make and a boat like you want to make and we'll see whose is the best that's a good idea okay let's do that all right let's do it [Music] welcome back to shipbuilding for pirates I'm swabby and now we know what volume means what Mass means and that together it can tell you something's density now let's find out why things float let's say we're out to sea and my treasure chest gets swept overboard oh no but it's all right it it floats because it pushes enough water out of the way displaces it to carry its mass but what if my treasure chest had more treasure in it well we're giving it more mass but not more volume too much mass and not enough volume I never think oh no my loonies you need more volume if you want to float more masks and that is why things flow I'm swabbing and thanks for joining me on shipbuilding for pirates so the first version of the tinfoil boat didn't work out too well but my idea is to build a tinfoil boat more like a canoe to see if a different shape makes any difference tinfoil canoe very Canadian very Canadian the canoe part anyway I don't know about the tinfoil part so Houston and I had a bit of a disagreement of why the last spoke didn't work I thought it was because it wasn't shaped enough like a boat so this one looks like a canoe what I thought is that it requires some structure structure so that it wouldn't fold together that's right and we'll see how it goes all right all right here we go oh did it work no okay your idea next [Music] did you know it's easier to float in salt water like in the Ocean than it is in fresh water like a lake or a pool that's because not all liquids are created equal they have different densities this is fresh water or it doesn't have anything in it and this is sugar if I was to put one scoop of sugar in this water and stir it around until it dissolves now this liquid is more dense than before I put the sugar in here's an experiment you can do at home using liquid density this glass just has regular water with yellow food coloring in it this glass green food coloring and half a cup of sugar in it this one has a full cup of sugar in it and this one has two cups of sugar in it now when you do this at home you'll definitely want an adult to help you because you have to heat the water if you want to dissolve that much sugar in one glass of water I'm gonna put them all in one container you can do this at home and when you do I suggest you use a very small container because you have to be very careful when you put the layers in you can use a turkey baster or a straw when you put your finger on top the air pressure will hold the liquid in and you can just drop it in but these kind of take some time so I'm going to use the syringe of science I'm going to use the most dense liquid first because that's the one that's going to want to be on the bottom I carefully put it on the bottom of the container the next layer be very careful and you'll see that the red and the blue aren't mixing because they have different densities the blue is heavier than the red the green and you can see even when it drips into the red it comes back up to the top because the green liquid isn't as dense as the red liquid and the denser liquids push the lighter liquid up and now we're going to add the yellow which of course has no sugar in it at all and there you go all the layers stay separate if you put it on a light you can really see it liquid densities now let's Max it out the longest length of liquid layers 12 liquids all organized by density starting from the bottom we have honey corn syrup chocolate syrup maple syrup dish soap whole milk water dyed blue vegetable oil extra virgin olive oil rubbing alcohol baby oil and lamp oil liquid density I really really want to mix it up but it took me a long time to make this so I'm not going to our first two attempts are the tinfoil boat haven't gone so well whose Nia's idea is to make a tinfoil boat and add some more structure because the tin foil just wants to collapse when I get in it so we start with a large piece of cardboard on the bottom then we wrap the tin foil around it and shape it into a boat after that we add some supports across the top to stop it from folding in when we add my weight to it this boat feels a lot stronger than the one I was just doing I told you so how does all of this work so we got some support using broomsticks and then some cardboard paper and then underneath we have cardboard cardboard and so how will all of this help the boat not sink with me right the broomsticks will prevent it from folding this way yeah and you won't sink good the cargo were prevented from folding this way and you won't sink again not sinking is my favorite thing to do in the tin foil boat all right so let's try it are you gonna get in this one I'll tell you what Phil if you get in and you don't sink I'll go after you deal all right all right here we go um no no no hold on hold on one two three go another thing I learned is that a very light tinfoil boat can be very heavy when it's full of water I don't know if fixing it is in the cards I think we I think we're gonna have to build another boat so what do you think we should do let's add more structure more structure oh yeah what if we add like a metal rod around the outside and maybe some more metal rods and rims and we wrap it all in tin foil and you think it'll work let's give it a try let's give it a try don't worry about it I've got this no I get it I'll get it sure again [Applause] to do an experiment with diapers oh oh oh no no I'm serious you may have a little brother or sister at home which means you probably know where you can find some diapers but there are two things you need to remember first ask an adult if you can use the diapers for your experiment and two only use unused diapers okay okay so take the diaper and if you cut it be very careful maybe get an adult to help you over some black construction paper like I have here and you shake the diaper over the construction paper you'll see that there's a little powder that comes out and this is the secret ingredient this is super absorbent gel what it does is it soaks up all the liquid and diapers are full of them and you carefully pour it into a plastic cup like that now you can see I have already done it with a number of diapers it's important to use a plastic cup because it's a little messy although it's non-toxic it's totally safe but it's still easier to clean up by just throwing the cup away now add some water and what happens is this super absorbent gel absorbs the water and turns very quickly into a paste look at that now let's Max it out five kilograms of super absorbent gel 500 liters of water now it is time to do science [Music] and I have my own stir stick [Music] yep definitely coming along there I'm not exactly sure if we're getting anything on this camera but I want to make sure it's recording yep it's recording there we go it is definitely turning solid well there you go the giant super absorbent gel experiment Corey Trevor I need some help getting out how many outfits have I been through in this episode foreign [Music] how many outfits have I been through in this episode anybody have a towel there you go thanks buddy that's that's great who's Nia's idea of adding structure to the tinfoil boat was definitely right we just needed to go further so we did it again this time we made a much larger boat we started with a sheet of cardboard then wrapped the tinfoil around and added some metal supports taped to the cardboard across the boat this way to make ribs as well as some other supporting pieces in the front and the back then another metal rod all the way around the top and finally supports across the middle all right feel how strong it is I'm really excited about this version of the tinfoil boat what we did is we used warts a big hard pieces of wood that we did last time but this time we have ribs ribs right which are made of a cardboard a metal rod attached to it and and shaped and we did a whole bunch of them then the gold the whole length of the boat and then we used all of this bendable metal and we have one that runs all the way around the gunnels and a whole bunch that run down the inside and we even used bike fenders at the front and the back of the boat to give it super rigidity so that it hopefully won't go like all the other boats have done so far are you ready who's Nia let's do this one two three lift right take it over floats but that doesn't tell us anything because they've all floated at this point it's only when I I get into it okay here we go all right hey hey it works all right oh it's working look at that it works perfectly the tinfoil boat experiment has been done science Max experiments at large what do you think Lucia the only reason I got into this book because I knew it's gonna work really oh yeah so you knew you would never get wet see I don't think that's fair I think it's time that you that you got wet I think we should go I think you and I should just get wet right now [Applause] that is so unfair greeting science maximize welcome to science Max experiments at large my name is Phil and today we're going to be looking at the power come on mag magnets you see magnets are fun things to experiment with because they are really okay they're really interesting um this magnet that I've got here is a neodymium magnet or a rare earth magnet it's one of this oh one of the one of the strongest magnets you can get um a magnet is an object that is attracted to anything that is feral magnets which is iron nickel or Cobalt and mag magnets are interesting because they have two sides there are two oh there are two poles I'd show you but I can't look at the chain off hold on one second all right there are two oh no there are two poles to every magnet just like the Earth there is a North Pole and a South Pole that's right the Earth is a giant magnet so if you take kitchen magnets you'll find that there's two different polls I've written north and south on these ones they don't normally come like that if you put the North and the South together they stick but if you put the north north or south and South together they repel they repel see they don't want to go together at all and you can force them together if you want but if you do they will Spring away the second you let them go but when magnets repel each other I find that some of the most interesting stuff check this out this is just a small container and I've got a magnet in here and I have a loonie attached to it so that it fits nicely in the container like that for the top I've attached two magnets together and I have another coin on it and if you put them in there I've made sure that the two poles repel each other which means this magnet will just sit there and Float magnetic levitation very interesting and you can pop the top on that if you want and just carry around a levitating magnet now there's a couple fancier ways you can levitate stuff with magnets this is just a wooden frame I've made this is completely not necessary you can use just about anything in your house a desk lamp works really well the important part is I've tied a magnet to the end of this arm here and this is a bolt which is attracted to the magnet but it's got a thread tied to it so it can't get there just far enough that it will actually hang in mid air look at that it's not attached to anything it's just being pulled up by the attraction from the magnet the thing is as soon as you pull the bolt away far enough it will lose the attraction and it'll just fall very cool here's one that's a little bit more complicated but it's also really neat this one uses disc magnets which have a circle or a hole in the middle of the mirror and you put two around a pencil and then four more in such a position that you can put the pencil against this wood on the side and it will just levitate on its own you can even give it a spin look at that and if you want to make the levitating pencil yourself there are step-by-step instructions on how to build an easy peasy version on our website meantime we are gonna Max this out magnetic levitation on science Max experiments at large but you're probably thinking what are we going to levitate well we're going to levitate meat at least that's the plan that's why I'm going to the Center for skills development and training come on all right okay who turned out the lights how what was that what is why is this room so small and only only going down to waist level this is the weirdest room I've ever been in where where am I what's going on oh hey Matt hi Phil this is Matt he's from job Master magnets now you guys use lots of big magnets right that's right we do awesome so maybe you could help me max out this wow you did a great job of building the levitating pencil experiment yeah so what's going on here exactly well all magnets have at least a north and a South Pole right and when you put like poles together they want to repel oh okay so have you ever levitated a person not yet well let's do it all right do you think we can use these we can try okay we'll uh put that one on the ground and okay so North and I'll put the north one on my foot here and then if I just step one wait a minute if I step stop moving if I step on there okay well first of all the this magnet keeps sort of moving away from me when I try to push down on it uh what do we do how do we fix this well we need to keep the magnets in position so that they don't move around when you try to put them together yeah because I have to come straight down on it that's right so why don't we attach this one to the floor good idea and then we'll put a board on this one we'll see how it goes perfect okay let's do it all right [Music] this is a magnet this is a magnet this is a magnet this is a shoe what's the what's the difference to know that you have to know your magnets this is a donut it does not stick to this magnet this is a spoon it sticks to this magma these paper clips stick to this magnet this shoe does not so what has attracted to magnets only things that are ferromagnetic here's the difference horseshoe horseshoe magnet this one is a magnet this one is not but the Horseshoe sticks to the horseshoe magnet because this one's a magnet and this one is ferromagnetic only things that a ferromagnetic are attracted to magnets things that are not attracted to magnets they're not ferromagnetic plastic banana Mitten sandwich magazine no but how do you know do you go around the world sticking a magnet to every single thing one at a time hey Ma I need you to come over I need to see if you're ferromagnetic no ferromagnetic no you don't need to do that first of all only metals are ferromagnetic so that eliminates all your clothing your luncheon meats your magazines what have you everything that's not metal you don't need to worry about never mind ma it doesn't matter but this clock is metal it doesn't stick well not all metals are ferromagnetic mainly just the ones with iron nickel or Cobalt now you know your magnets I hit the phone on the magnet there okay uh can you hear me ma hang up the phone hang up hang up the phone man my first attempt at levitating had the magnets sliding all over So the plan is to take the bottom magnet and attach it to a big wooden board so it won't go anywhere then attach another plank to the top magnet to make it a little easier to stand on okay that is definitely attached to the floor thank you all right now if I just get this lined up oh look at that it could totally oh wait a minute totally it doesn't want to stay put wait a minute they let me take it come on levitate why doesn't it want to stay and it just doesn't hmm should I stand on it okay I'll stand on it here we go and ah am I levitating no no hmm so why isn't this working well just like your pencil experiment we need a shaft through the center to hold the magnets in position oh yeah maybe we could use like a ring magnet yes that like we used with the pencil right and and we're gonna need stronger magnets we're gonna need stronger magnets are the ring magnets strong yes they can be awesome all right let's do it all right now it's time for a science Max quiz which one of these things do we have magnetism to thank for birds flying south in the winter music or a sandwich if you picked a you're right some birds migrate in the spring and Fall using the Earth's magnetic field many the animals can sense the Earth's magnetic field and use it to navigate migrating birds fly hundreds or thousands of kilometers North or South when they migrate in the spring and fall a compass works the same way by using magnetism to point to the Earth's magnetic north pole but if you picked B music you're right here's some music the way you're hearing this music is because the musicians recorded their instruments using microphones which use magnets and then the signal was translated by a computer and stored on its hard drive which uses magnets then it was broadcast to your TV and comes out your speakers which use you guessed it magnets and for those of you who said you have magnetism to thank for your sandwich well you're right you see you'd probably go to the kitchen to make that sandwich right well I'm guessing you got all of the tasty ingredients from your refrigerator well it works on electricity which is produced by magnets and then there's an electric motor in the fridge that circulates the air and keeps it cool and guess what magnets and finally the door on your fridge stays closed because the door has magnets there you go you can take magnetism for birds flying south music and your sandwich it just goes to show when you're talking about magnets everybody wins because Magnus are everywhere they has been a science Max quiz [Music] here's an experiment you can do with a bag of water take a sharpened pencil and carefully push it through the bag if you do it carefully it won't spill the reason this works is because the bag is made of polymers long stretchy chains of molecules and also because the pressure of the water against the pencil prevents any water from spilling out now we're gonna Max it out a very large bag of water and here I have some very large pencils you ready foreign that's one that's two here we go should I go from the bottom science okay okay okay I know what you want like I was saying turns out trying to balance two repelling magnets on top of each other is pretty much impossible here's why this is a magnet and here is the magnetic field it's often drawn with lines like this but actually the magnetic field radiates out in all directions really think of the magnetic field kind of like a ball when you try to balance another magnet on top of the first magnet it's about as hard as balancing one ball on top of another ball so here's the plan just like the levitating pencil we're going to use ring magnets because we can put a shaft through the center of one ring then drop another ring magnet on the shaft it will keep them perfectly aligned then it's just a matter of putting the bottom magnet on a board to keep it stable and using another board so I can stand on it and ta-da magnetic levitation or at least that's the plan okay board magnets magnets look at that awesome and now I'm gonna put the platform on nice and I got some weights here let's see how this works yeah this is going to work amazing all right I think I should try it give it a try okay here we go huh yeah yeah I'm doing it I'm eating what just a little bit oh really yeah so hmm yeah what do we do we need more power more power I like that idea how do we give it more power uh more shafts more magnets okay sure well why don't we do um why don't we do one two three four shafts and then we'll have magnets on all the shafts great idea all right let's do it [Music] if you attach something ferromagnetic like this washer to a magnet not only does it stick but the magnetic field travels down the metal making it a magnet too which means you can stick more and more things to each other and they will continue to stick until you run out of magnetic field you can do this yourself at home with anything ferromagnetic paper clips work pretty well or washers like I have or screws or bolts and they'll continue to stick to each other as long as the magnetic field is strong enough you can see it's getting pretty weak here and they'll all stay magnetized as long as the first one is still attached [Applause] to the magnet but if you want to go even further all you need to do is keep adding more magnets to reinforce the magnetic field I've got a few here this let's get the chain started that and then I've got a magnet attached to this washer so it will keep the magnetic field strong and I continue to add a one magnet one washer and we'll just see how far I can go you can even sculpt it a little bit look at that and then at the end a whole bunch of paper clips eventually the weight will make it fall off but it's a lot of fun to play with magnets and make art speaking of art you can make with magnets you could also make sculptures when everything sticks to everything else you can make some pretty fancy designs this is a rare earth magnet a very strong one and a bunch of nuts that I've gotten and this one here is an electromagnet but electromagnets are a little different because they need an electric current to work check this out this is sort of a magnet dude with crazy hair there's an earth magnet here and this is a giant screw and these are some metal bits and then I've got two more magnets at the top here to hold on his crazy wire hair he's got crazy wire here because he's crazy magnitude now of course we couldn't just talk about magnetic sculptures without maxing it out so let's Max it out this is a bunch of scrap metal from leftover experiments and I've got a bunch of rare earth magnets and now I'm gonna max out a magnet sculpture see there you go a maxed out magnet me I made this guy out of metal pipes with Earth magnets in between and these are his arms attached of course with magnets his hand to his little metal pieces attached with magnet steel wool for the hair and of course hat non-magnetic all right here we go ready want to see a magic trick simple copper tube drop things through it [Music] nothing unusual happens but watch when I drop a magnet through what what it's not magic it's science because the magnet creates a magnetic field when it goes through the tube the magnetic field repels the magnet upwards now the field isn't perfect so the magnet doesn't come to a stop but still it slows down from a fall to a nice graceful drop take a look from above pretty amazing right magnets not Magic science [Music] so I've managed to levitate on some magnets but just barely what Matt and I needed was more power so instead of having one shaft and one pair of ring magnets we're going to use a larger board and put a shaft on each Corner then we'll have four times the power because we're using four times the magnets hopefully this will be strong enough to get me floating on a cushion of magnetic energy and magnets magnets okay here we go hahaha this is gonna work great and top board mm-hmm what do you think looks great yeah okay here we go mad be levitating I'm levitating all right it feels cool it's sort of like it sort of feels like surfing a little bit all right thank you so much Matt that was amazing and there you have it science Max experiments at large magnetic levitation you know I'm surprised we could do an entire episode on magnets and we never actually got them so close to the camera that the camera went all weird because Cameron's a magnets they don't oh dear oh um no that's okay I can I can I can fix this if I just maybe you know if maybe if I put the magnet to the camera again that way oh oh okay that didn't help oh okay well thanks very much for watching uh science Max experiments at large and uh we'll see you again uh as soon as we get a new camera oh hi science maximites have you ever been eating pasta and wondered what could I build with this could I build something that could hold an impressive amount of weight well I have and that's what we're gonna do today on science Max experiments at large but we're not going to use cook pasta because it's too delicious we're gonna use uncooked pasta Which is less delicious but it's great for building we're gonna make a pasta Bridge here's how you do it first you want to start with a plan and then you want to take your pasta I'm saying pasta but of course spaghetti is usually the best thing to use and lay it out on your plan the reason you have a plan is so that you can make sure all of the spaghetti is exactly the right length lay it out on your plan perfectly aligned like that there and now it's time to glue it all together now you can use white glue but it takes a long time so I suggest a hot glue gun but make sure you get an adult's permission before you use one of these okay so you take your plan you lay it out you glue it up don't glue it on the paper because that will be bad and you will end up with your truss and it looks just like this now remember you want two sides because those are the sides of your bridge and as you can see I've used several strands of pasta because that'll make it a little bit stronger once you have your trusses it's time for the next part of the plan this is the roadway and it works the same way lay out your pasta glue it up and Bam there it is now you put your trusses on your roadway and you glue them all together and you also want to put some struts along the top here probably to keep it nice and rigid in the end you will end up with a fantastic looking pasta Bridge pretty good huh no pasta Bridge no other Bridge could claim to be 100 pasta minus the glue 99.8 pasta 0.2 glue I say that Captain set sail set sailed for the land of pasta bridges now if that was pretty fast for you don't worry all the instructions are gonna be on our website now a bridge is in a bridge unless it spans a gap because that's what bridges are for so you put your pasta Bridge up there across the books like that and then you can see just how much weight the bridge holds it's pretty impressive if you build it right even something is flimsy and as delicate as pasta can hold quite a bit of weight I like to use big heavy blocks and put them in the Middle where there is no support from the books whatsoever and just keep adding heavy things and see how much weight the bridge will hold before it breaks how much will it hold well I'm not going to tell you that's where you get to be science maximites and find out for yourselves and now we're gonna Max it out today on oh my pasta today on science Max experiments at large we're going to be looking at how fragile things can become strong if you build them right we're also going to be maxing out the pasta Bridge experiment to see if we can make one that's strong enough to hold me you think we can do it I know I have no idea but I'm going to the Center for skills and development and training to find out [Music] all right oh hey Kyle Phil how you doing great thanks awesome this is Kyle he's got a masters in civil engineering uh did you want some pasta I'm good I can go back and get some more really I'm good okay so what does a Civil Engineer do well a civil engineer builds the world around us talk about our homes keeping us warm in the winter our roads hey even our Bridges bridges that's fantastic because that's what I need your help with I want to max out the pasta Bridge awesome I want to make one big enough that I can walk across it okay that's never been done before I know right you think we can do it we're going to need a lot of help to do that now we don't need help all we need is a lot of pasta which I have nice what do you say yeah let's give it a shot okay we'll give it a shot why don't we just take some to start and then going in order to max out our pasta Bridge the idea is to take many many strands of pasta and just keep gluing them together so the long beams of pasta in our giant bridge is nothing but many many regular sized brands of pasta here's where we were after 20 minutes of gluing there that's nice yeah I I think this piece is done okay so how does it work is it is it strong well let's give it a go eh yeah I think this will hold great so we just need to build a few more of these then right yeah that's right how many more 212 more 212 of these more 212 that's but it took us like 20 minutes to make this one yeah oh well I guess so I mean this is science Max experiments at large that's what we do we just keep building and building and you know I don't have any plans for the next while so uh Phil I think that there's a better way of doing this I would be delighted to know there's a better way you'll be faster than this much faster sure let's do it awesome I'm just gonna put the pasta back in the bag because it it'll kill you you don't have to do that no no but it'll get stale Phil I'm gonna call in one of my friends we're probably gonna need some more help with this oh man that's a great idea sorry that's a great idea because it's it's there's yeah because at least we can get your friend to help clean up better sand castles in 80 Seconds building sand castles is fun but you can't use dry sand because it doesn't stay up very well you have to use wet sand but even if you use wet sand it doesn't hold a lot of weight but if you use sand with the power of science it does hold the weight right hand wet sand sand here's what's going on say these ping-pong balls are grains of sand when they're dry they don't hold together very well that's why you can't build a sand castle out of dry sand but if you get the sand wet a little bit the grains of sand will hold together a little better because of the surface tension of the water that's why it's easier to build a sand castle with wet sand but they still won't hold much weight but if you add something that creates even more friction between the grains of sand like say this sandpaper it will hold the weight so here's what you do take Windows screen and cut it into circles make sure you get an adult's permission first okay deal put in a layer of sand pack it down and put in a circle of Windows screen and a layer of sand pack it down circle of window screen then you guessed it layers and pack it down circle of window screen the window screens are going to add more friction between the grains of sand and will make your sand castle strong strong with the power of Science and then you can put lots of weight on it and there you go sand with the power of science okay I had to Max it out let's see how strong science and really is huh ah science our pastor Bridge was going to take a long time to build out of individual pieces so we have a new plan hey Michaela hey Phil how you doing I'm great how are you good this is Michaela she's an undergrad in industrial engineering right I am and you and Kyle have a new plan for how we can build our pasta Bridge that's not going to look like this this is the best that Kyle and I could do with 20 minutes okay good I'm glad how are we going to do it so instead of that we're going to try something like this oh okay this is sort of like a giant burrito kind of thing right yep but we're going to build the bridge out of this exactly uh we're gonna make it longer though yep we're gonna make it eight feet long we have this long Pole yep and we have sheets of this pasta we're gonna put them on the diagonal okay are we gonna roll it but we're gonna start from this corner and we're gonna keep rolling and don't forget to add water and we gotta Add Water I'll add the water okay adding water just like this yep it helps the pasta to stick together as we're rolling we're rolling we're rolling we're gonna keep doing this with a bunch more sheets so that it gets really really long like eight feet long and when we're finally done rolling we gotta spray it with some varnish yep and so it all holds together great and then it's going to be about this thick yeah when we're finished with it exactly this is going to be one of the parts of the deck of our Bridge great so each one of these large pieces is going to be like one single strand of pasta and the little Bridge yeah we need a lot of these a lot a lot still it's a lot faster than doing it piece by piece with just oh every time I hold it up you make that noise oh awesome [Laughter] [Music] the shape of something makes a big difference in how strong it is get some toilet paper rolls and put them in a square and then stack books on top of them they can hold wait thing is they can actually hold a lot more weight than you probably think in fact the amount of weight just paper in a tube can hold is really kind of impressive [Music] and now let's Max it out kills weight on two toilet paper rolls nope Bill's weight on four toilet paper rolls nope Bill's weight on six toilet paper rolls nope feels weight on 10. toilet paper rolls cool Bill's way can be supported by 10 toilet paper rolls but what if Phil jumps didn't really work Kyle and Michaela's plan is to use a long pole and sheets of uncooked pasta we roll the pasta around the pole and spray it with a little varnish We Roll sheets and sheets of pasta along an eight foot long pole making many layers of pasta then we wait for it to dry and remove the pull what we have is an eight foot Long Hollow tube of pasta that becomes a single piece of the bridge then we attach a bunch of these pieces together and use more sheets of pasta to glue them into the shape we used for our small pasta Bridge we're making our giant pasta bridge by wrapping sheets of pasta around and around the poles using the technique we just had making a whole large pole out of many many many sheets of pasta rolled around each other and we've made a giant truss look at this this is great guys it's looking pretty good yeah if I hit it you think it'd stay together what this is pasta not steel it's only made to just hold you Kyle what do you think are the chances that this is gonna hold me when we build it something like 50 50. not bad Michaela what do you think I'm gonna hold for the best hoping for the best that's exactly the kind of gray area we like to work in at science Max experiments at large experiments at large I don't know if anybody's even ever done this before not to my knowledge I don't think so which is why we have no idea if it's going to work okay so uh one more of these because these are the sides roadway and then the top yup yup all right let's do it while we're waiting it's a good moment to point out one of the things that makes our Bridge really strong that is triangles as you can see the truss or the side of our bridge is really just three big triangles triangles are very strong shapes to build with and they work great in bridges now it's time for science so simple a caveman could do it this is a caveman ah today we are going to teach this caveman how to build a strong structure here are some boxes go on and build a shelter and I'll come back and see how it worked out all right no no no no that's not right ah you need to build walls by stacking boxes on top of each other that's how you build understand oh yes I'll come back later and see how it worked out yeah oh does that look right to you yeah look at those boxes they're stacked on top of each other but if they are in tall Stacks what would happen if you push on the wall oh you see walls don't stay up if you build like that let's try again I'll help you this time first lay out the foundation where your wall should go God now let's make a second level no no don't put it right on top you need to stack in between that's how you make a strong wall [Music] okay I I'll come back later yeah nice work why don't you give it a try ah looks strong but you forgot a box huh join us next time when we talk about how to make a door [Music] building a door in a wall is hard because how do you make a big gaping hole in your wall without your wall ing over well people have come up with lots of ways to put doors and windows in walls made of stone blocks over the centuries and you can do this at home with books like I'm doing or with building blocks just go up until you're happy with the height and then stack each next layer a little closer to the middle until the final layer touches just like this and then you take a big heavy buck and you drop it right on top and it's pretty stable and you've just made a doorway it works even better if it's part of a wall because you want extra weight on the outside of these books here so of course I had to build one that was part of a whole wall this is the same corbled Arch built out of little building blocks and as you can see I went closer and closer together until it meets at the top and it is very strong now let's Max it out the kind of arch we're building is a corbled arch and the science Max build team and I are using pieces of wood cut to different lengths how high can it go we can use my head too no okay wait wait it takes a while to get together but once it's done it looks just like kinds of doorways Stone buildings had in ancient times there you go and maxed out Coralville Arch we went straight up until we got to these layers and they got a little bit closer and closer to the middle and to the last piece is one big solid piece and if we built this right it should be strong enough to hold me up science [Applause] foreign it held me up for a minute didn't it we rolled our pasta and constructed one Truss now we've made a lot more rolls of pasta and connected them all together to make a second truss and a roadway as well as the cross braces on top and when we get it all together we end up with Wow pasta Bridge oh we did it we built it we have no idea how long it will stay up but it's up it's doing its Bridge thing for now anyway I am very excited because as far as we know I'm the only one to try to cross a bridge made out of pasta what do you guys think I think I don't want you to be the last person to cross the past the bridge you're absolutely right but I'm gonna do it I think I think we're ready yeah yeah okay here we go [Music] oh no that doesn't bode well for our pasta Bridge what what happened here Kyle you put all your weight in the middle of the joist it snapped uh-huh if only there was a way to distribute your weight maybe if you crawled to like the military style kind of oh right so that I'm putting my weight on more than one spot yeah yeah exactly oh wait a minute that gives me an idea you guys stay right there I have I I know what to do I know what to do I know what to do you're coming back right skis distribute your weight over a large area so you don't sink in the snow that's what skis do which is perfect for the pasta Bridge come on okay okay come on everybody uh-huh is it working it's working I hear some cracking this might do it try to try to spread your legs apart spreading my legs apart distribute your way Distributing my weight swaying a lot oh man high fives there you go science Max experiments at large pasta Bridge skis what more could you want maybe a pasta chair lift of some sort science today's science Max is all about balance okay if it's a potato or if it's me figuring out how things balance is what we're all about it works really well [Music] swinging spinning and staying put today on science Max experiments at Large [Music] greetings science maximites today we're going to be talking about whoa balance or what you call balance in science which is center of gravity now the center of gravity is a place you can find in any object where it's equally balanced on all sides I balanced this spoon on the Eraser of this pencil and where the spoon is balancing is its center of gravity but if I take this little tiny diamond put it in the spoon it doesn't balance anymore but if I put the dime in the spoon and balance it in a different spot I can find the new center of gravity and the spoon balances again here's another experiment you can do take up a dough and a ruler or a stick try to balance the potato on the ruler foreign it's really hard to do the potato does have a center of gravity but because of its shape it's going to be really hard to find and really hard to balance but if you take some forks and you stick them into the potato you're no longer just trying to balance the potato you have to balance the forks and the potato and it gives it a very different center of gravity which makes it a little bit easier to find and a little bit easier to balance let's take a closer look at how the center of gravity Works using our potatoes no that's too close back off a little bit okay good if you want to find where the center of gravity is you can hang an object and draw a line straight down then hang it from a different spot and draw another line do this one or two more times and you can see where the lines meet is the center of gravity if our potato was balanced on a stick the center of gravity is a long way from the stick so it's going to be pretty hard to balance now let's stick some Forks in the potato and try again one line there a line there and a line there and you can see that the lines all come together down here that's right the center of gravity doesn't have to be on the object with the center of gravity way down there when we try to balance the potato and the forks on the stick you can see the center of gravity is much closer to the stick that makes it way easier to balance now because your science maximize I'm sure you know that a potato and forks is just the beginning everything you have in your house has a center of gravity which means theoretically you can balance anything try it yourself find things around the house and see if you can get them to balance and if you can't try adding things to increase the center of gravity and make it a little bit easier now we're gonna Max it out that's why [Music] I'm gonna go to the Center for skills development and training and we're going to explore center of gravity even more see if we can get something to balance and what better thing to balance than me oh table right hey this is Sandia and swapna no Sandia and swapna right and they are going for their phds in science and you guys thank you for coming thank you work with let's talk science right that's right all about Science Education just like us and I'm glad you guys are here because I need to max out this oh look at it balance [Music] okay I got it I got it okay so we're gonna get a gigantic potato uh no I thought we would use me instead so you're the potato uh yeah I guess I'm the potato all right and I need something to balance on well how about a tightrope oh yeah a tightrope have either of you done a tightrope before nope nope me neither all right let's set one up all right okay good oh yeah we're gonna take our balancing potato experiment and Max it out to get a potato to balance is pretty hard but if you stick Forks in the potato it works a lot better in our maxed out version we're gonna balance on a slack line which is sort of like a tightrope it's a flat strap tightened between two points and in this version I'm the potato and instead of sticking giant Forks in me which is not something I want to try Sandia swapna and I are going to experiment to see what I can do to improve my balance foreign there we're using this ratchet strap above a crash mat because we only have it about three feet off the ground but it's still going to be really hard to balance on right right okay so who gets to go first okay here we go um ready okay I think what you need to do is spread your mess out more to be able to find that center of gravity easier so I should balance on one leg start by trying to put your arms out let's try it again trying it again all right all right arms oh okay let's see if this works okay when I say You're Gonna Let Go ready all right one two three go [Music] nope just a little bit better it was a little bit better a little longer that way I went from one second to three seconds yeah yes I would like to actually take one step that would be nice well what else can we do maybe we can try weights try and pull them out if I have weights in my hands that would increase the center of gravity in terms of putting in the weight on the outside you guys have something we can use sure yeah okay good wow these are heavy okay they're weights yes therefore they're supposed to be heavy good call when I hold this one and I'll borrow your shoulder so on and then when I say Sandia pass me the other way here we go ready and pass me the way okay that didn't work okay good whoa whoa okay let go [Music] it's really hard I feel I would work better if I could lift the weights up but they're too heavy for that all right so what else can we do well tightrope Walkers use a long pull so that they can balance on a tightrope that's right I've seen that uh do we have a pole we have to go find one okay great I'll put the weights away have you ever heard someone say I will be back in a jiffy well now you can tell them that's almost impossible you see a jiffy is an actual measure of time it's 1 100th of a second you see this timer the first number is seconds the second number is tenths of a second and that third number that you can't even read it's going so fast that's hundredths of a second each one of those is a jiffy here are some things that happen in a jiffy a cheetah moving top speed travels 20 centimeters a hummingbird flaps its wings almost once can you blink in a jiffy nope takes 10 jiffies for that how about snapping your fingers eight jiffies so the next time someone tells you I'll be back in a jiffy you can tell them it took 170 jiffies just to say that so I tried walking the slack line and I wasn't very good at it holding my arms out at my sides seemed to help a little then I tried holding some weights to see if that would make any difference and the weights were so heavy I couldn't really hold them out very far now the plan is to try a long pole tightrope Walkers use long poles to help them balance the longer the pole is the more it affects your center of gravity especially because you can move it up and down to help you stay balanced nice so the important thing on this is what the the balance right yeah I want to find the center of gravity of that as well so try and find the center of the stone the center is right there that's where it balances there you got it okay how do I hold this and get up on the on the strap I'll help you you're gonna help me okay oh okay uh-huh oh okay I think yeah I think I got it okay yeah oh you're balancing check it out hey this isn't so bad hey look at that you can really use it to help correct when you start to fall you just move the pole and that's whoa totally helping my center of gravity stay right in the center above the strap you can do it a long pole can help tightrope Walkers and me balance in two ways first it lowers my center of gravity normally a person center of gravity is about here but with a pole it changes to way down here much lower to the thing I'm walking on but a long pole also helps in another way because in order to fall off the Rope I have to rotate it's easier to rotate something that has mass in the middle than it is when the mass is spread out that's why you put your arms out when you want to balance a pole works just like your arms The Mask gets spread out way more and it makes it much harder to rotate around the rope and fall off there you go center of gravity we're done usually we don't have it figured out this quickly usually we struggle a little bit more all right high fives we did it go way to go um so we did it yeah we achieved what we set out to do balanced with a pole so how else can we use science to make my balance better well tops are great because they when they're spinning they balance that's right so the forces used when something spins is something I can use yeah all right this calls for another small experiment are you guys good here yeah sure we'll keep practicing awesome all right back to the lab [Music] of course here's another experiment that's all about balance take a pencil and try to balance it on its tip doesn't work that well does it but if you take a pencil and stick it through a circle of cardboard and try it again it works the reason it's because this circle is spinning it creates a force that keeps the pencil standing up as long as the circle is spinning fast enough it counteracts the force of gravity because of the conservation of angular momentum the conservation of angular momentum the conservation of angular momentum presents would sound super smart a top wheel balance when it's spinning it works because it spins but why say it that way when you can impress your friends and all the adults you know by saying conservation of angular momentum why does a Top Spin because of the conservation of angular momentum between you and me we know that it boils down to the fact that it's spinning but conservation of angular momentum is how you say it if you're studying physics in University just remember to thank science Max when you impress Everyone by telling them a top balances because of say it with me the conservation of angular momentum now let's Max this out gyroscopic force is pretty amazing because this bike tire is spinning it's hard for me to move it but it's really hard to see how much it resists a change in orientation unless I do this it looks like it's Defying Gravity but really it's because the amount of force needed to change its orientation is more than the force of gravity pulling down on it it won't last forever only as long as the bike tire keeps spinning but you got to admit it's pretty cool science [Music] look at that it totally balances yeah so this is this is a great way to balance do you think it'll work if I hold it well let's see you try all right um I'm gonna use you to get up on the thing and then you go give her yeah that's good and spinning it up here we go ready yep okay yeah you can feel it I can really feel it resisting and it I think it would work I think it just needs to be spinning a lot faster that would make even stronger yeah uh it kind of hit my chest so you know what maybe you should keep it out to one side well it's still spinning yeah a little oh that I think you need two oh yeah you're right one on either side it'd be great if we could actually have some way to you I can keep my arms free though yeah oh I know get two wheels and we rope them into some sort of backpack situation and we have a way for you guys to get the wheels spinning really fast I don't know no no I have it all in my head trust me come on I'll show you I'll show you wait you guys go around come don't go on that side of the of [Music] the time for a Mini Max here's how you can use the forces of things spinning around to defy gravity well sort of take a ping pong ball and put it in a plastic container like a cup or this is the top of a CD spindle put it in and start spinning it around if you do it right you can get the ball spinning only on the sides of your container and not touching the bottom that's centripetal force at work thank you oh it works a lot better and is much more impressive if you have something that doesn't have a bottom fortunately I do this bucket doesn't have a bottom put the ping pong ball in the bucket and spin it around and if I'm very careful I can lift the bucket into the air and ta-da I'm defying the force of gravity science now I know what you're thinking you're thinking Phil is that it is that all you're going to do no of course not this is science Max experiments at Large this is a garbage can with no bottom in it and this is a bag of golf balls let's see what happens when we put them together well I managed to keep one golf ball in my garbage can but as you can see it works really well [Music] and there you go sort of maxed out [Music] this is a garbage can with the bottom cut out and this is a soccer ball I'm gonna see if I can keep the soccer ball inside the garbage can using centripetal force okay [Music] it's working it's very tiring though how do you throw out a garbage can that's been used science here's a fun experiment you can do that plays with the forces created when you spin something get a flat platform or a tray and tie rope to every corner get an adult to help you with this then you get a cup of water use a plastic cup definitely just in case you put it on the tray and you start spinning now the force is created when you spin something centripetal force pulls the water to the outside of the circle and because the centripetal force is stronger than the force of gravity no water spills out of the cup even when it's upside down slow it down very carefully you'll see that all the water is still in your cup now I definitely suggest you do this experiment outside and I definitely definitely suggest you do it with an adult because when you get tired which you will if you don't stop it carefully you'll have to explain what you've been doing science to improve my balance has totally worked so far so now Sandia swapna and I are trying to figure out how to use the forces created when a wheel spins to help me balance we need a spinning wheel on one side and one on the other I've decided to take two bikes and remove the handlebars seats and front wheels then cross them over each other and attach them to a backpack Sandy and swapna can use the pedals to spin the tires fast and I will use the gyroscopic Force to balance or at least that's the plan gold the gyroscopic stabilization away I'm excited okay I think it's gonna work I think so I'm kind of skeptical really you're skeptical why I don't know I don't know if you can do it I don't know if I can do it either but that's why we do science let's see it okay Spin Me Up okay huh ready yeah all right and oh ready go oh yeah it's working cool it's working it's actually working it's good what's getting harder it's getting harder that worked really well until the wheels stop spinning yeah and then what happened well when the wheel was spinning it was resisting Motion in all directions so that you wouldn't fall yeah but when they stopped spinning you didn't have that anymore that doesn't do anything it's just a 50 pound weight on my back exactly right so I guess that's why tightrope Walkers don't use spinning wheels they use a pole instead right but we've proven that they can exactly yeah Max said high five yeah I now have the balance of a ninja circus performer thanks to science thanks for watching seismax experiments at large okay Spin Me Up spin me up and we'll do some more science Irish stuff it's backpack to the rescue all right let's go foreign control come in Mission Control ah this is Mission Control Phil uh we read you loud and clear I would agree greeting science greetings greeting science maximites welcome to science Max experiments at large my name is Phil mccordick and today we're going to be building an air-powered rocket too difficult you say nonsense it's easy it's not like it's rocket science hey it is rocket science cool here's what you need you need a bottle and a cork make sure that the cork fits nicely into the bottle and then you need an air pump because you can't have an air powered rocket without air and on this air pump you need a PIN the special kind that you use to inflate basketballs or volleyballs or stuff like that now what you want to do is push the pin through the cork you might want an adult's help for this push it through until it goes through on the other side and then make sure you get a good seal with the bottle now you're ready to launch a rocket with air pressure but first let's do a few other things take your cork and put it in a tripod launcher you can make this out of pencils or anything you want as long as it stands up nice and solidly and then of course you want to decorate your bottle so it looks like a rocket this is my rocket pretty good right so stick the bottle on the cork like before like that and then you stick the pin in the bottom and what we're going to do is we're going to inflate the bottle with air pressure and then it's gonna launch okay here we go uh you know rocketry really isn't something you should do indoors come on [Music] come on hey this was supposed to be a field thank you going why are there oh it's in my shoe huh oh oh this will do nicely now don't forget to do this with an adult and don't forget your safety glasses now set up the rocket in a nice big open area and make sure it's pointed away from you and then what you do is you pump the air pump and it puts air into the rocket which pushes down on the water which will push down on the cork until eventually [Music] so B science maximites and come up with your own rocket design try different amounts of water different fins even different size bottle try for yourself and see if you can get one that goes higher than mine just did how did I get in I think it was this way [Music] do you want step-by-step directions on how to build your own air powered rocket well don't worry everything you need is on our website foreign now it is time to max out our air powered rocket I've got Adam here hey Adam hey Phil how you doing good how are you good Adam's from Logics Academy Logix Academy and you guys going to schools and talk about science we do fantastic do you guys do a air powered rocket yes does it look like this one looks exactly okay oh that's great so how do we Max this out so we want to add more pressure to this bottle to try to get it to launch a little bit higher more air more great so what do we do so we're gonna use one of these oh the air compressor right which works a lot like the bike pump right yeah exactly cool so we're gonna have compressed air coming from here through this tube into underneath here yeah and out knocking on until there and you're going to put your bottle on top and out of the nozzle seconds of the bottle like that yep and now we want to be able to hold it in place we're gonna have these little fingers here that are actually going to work to hold it until we want to let it go so we're going to lock it in place oh yeah look at that totally locked exactly and then what how do we launch oh you're gonna take this cord and go a safe distance away and we are going to pull it and then we would pull it which one you want to start with I think we should use this one here okay great now we put water in it right yep why do we use water so the water is going to act to push the rocket up in the air the air is gonna the compressed air in here is going to shoot the water out the back and the water is going to push on the rocket and make it launch it's just to give it a little extra push how do I get it on there without spilling any water so just rest it next to you just go faster yeah just go really fast there we go and then lock it in place locking it in place there's no air pressure in the hose yet right yeah no first we have to spool out the launch cord so the air compressor has the compressed air in it it's ready to go yep it's all ready to go we just need to connect the hoses Adam I've noticed it's snowing a little bit if you think that's any reason why we should stop I don't think so no the science Must Go On glass Shields down connecting hoses when we connect the air hose the pressure from the compressor travels down the line and into the bottle you can see the bubbles of air going in those bubbles are carrying more air into the bottle giving it more pressure here we go three two one [Music] all right another rocket let's do it again launch it get three two one nice [Laughter] success success nice so small bottle worked really well how do we make it bigger I know a bigger nose cone I think a bigger bottle oh bigger bottle yeah of course that's easy uh how about this empty water bottle that we have now that might work except that the top here is too big I don't think it'll fit on our launcher oh yeah so what should we use liter pop bottle might work a bit better because it'll be the same size oh that's right two liter pop bottles have the same opening as as these small small water bottles exactly that's great all right let's uh make a couple Rockets out of two liter pop bottles awesome pressure happens when you squeeze something or compress it solids do not compress very well I will demonstrate um solid is it compressing no okay liquids don't compress very well either you can demonstrate this for yourself by getting a plastic water bottle and filling it right to the very top with water and putting on the cap and squeezing you'll find that you can't really squeeze the bottle very much but if you empty out half of the water no don't pour it on the floor and then put the cap back on the bottle and try to squeeze it you'll find that you can squeeze it a lot more that's because gases compress much easier than solids or liquids here's what's going on say this container is well any container and these magnets are air molecules now I'm going to put the magnets in pull to pull so they repel each other and want to stay a certain distance apart just like air molecules do there we go a container at normal gas pressure now watch what happens when I add more gas molecules they start to get squeezed together and if I add more the amount of space that each one gets is less and less now this container is under a lot of pressure these molecules really want to escape through the top of the container but they can't because I'm holding them down if I took something like this one closure and I push them down even more now they're really Under Pressure they want to get out but they can't because I'm holding them in now watch what happens when I let them go they all pop out the top and the container has returned to normal gas pressure that's what happens when we put gas in a container like this one these containers that hold compressed gas are made out of solid steel because you need something really strong or it might explode if you put too much gas pressure in it that's why these are only filled up by professionals who know exactly how much pressure it can take that is the power of pressure foreign our air-powered rocket was working pretty well but there's always room to Max it out in order to do that we need to understand how it works first we fill the bottle almost halfway with water and then we add air to the bottle the air pressure builds up and the air presses down on the water the rocket takes off when we pull on the release valve which was blocking the opening of the bottle once that happens the air pushes out the water it's the water that gives us our thrust so the water is very important once all the water is gone the air escapes and the bottle returns to normal air pressure but by that time it's high in the sky now the plan is to use two liter bottles instead of regular water bottles to see if they work better now we've made a few more Rockets out of two liter bottles and I'm Gonna Fill This one up with water and we're going to fire it we'll fire it again and see what happens now with the idea is that these will work better because they have more volume and more volume means we could possibly put more air pressure in it's hard to know until you try it of course but the other reason why it might work better it's two liter bottles generally hold carbonated beverages which means they already have to be made a little stronger than regular water bottles because they have to hold in the carbonation which is just like air pressure all right ready to go okay here we go you ready Adam yep okay let's yield down pressurize three two one let's do another one and three two one wow this is the superhero design rocket which I'm very excited about all right Adam it's going really well but before we fire this next one how can we make it bigger better and more awesome we're getting more pressure more pressure how do we do that well we're firing a boat 90 PSI right now PSI pounds per square inch of pressure right so we could increase it we could increase it so how we're at 90 now how high does the tank go go to about 120. 120 PSI let's see what happens all right okay here we go 90 110 100 and 20. should we fire it fire it let's fire it here we go three two one [Music] all right hey actually it worked okay there's just a piece missing here but I think the bottle is still okay yeah so two liter bottle full pressure I think we can still make something even better even more maxed out um what if we use an even bigger bottle you know the five liter ones that you see on water cooler yeah you think we can use one of those definitely I think we could use that we need to change the mouthpiece all right yes to fit our launchers well let's do it do it [Music] money bags now help and beat crushed by all this pressure a whole kilogram is being pushed down on every Square centimeter of my body 103 kilopasicles uh actually one kilogram for every Square centimeter on your body it's the exact kind of pressure that you and I are under at all times every day we don't notice it because we're used to it but it sounds like a lot doesn't it well it is here's an experiment you can do with a plastic bottle say at room temperature there are 10 millionaire molecules in here it doesn't really matter how many but we'll say there's 10 million at normal room temperature what happens if I heat up the air inside this bottle this is warm water what I'm trying to do is heat up the air inside the bottle because the air molecules when they get hotter move faster and need more room so the 10 million air molecules are starting to escape out the mouth of the bottle and reducing the number of air molecules inside and now I take the bottle out and cap it because the air molecule is heated up and speed it up they needed more room now there's less of them in the bottle there's about 4 million air molecules inside this bottle but they're all hot air molecules and they have a higher pressure and you don't notice it because the air out here isn't crushing the bottle but watch what happens if I cool the air inside the bottle this is ice water so what's happening now is the molecules are slowing down and they need less space so they need less room and they're being crushed by the pressure on the outside of the bottom it has been crushed because the colder air molecules don't need the same kind of room as the hot air molecules the room temperature air has crushed the bottle the air inside has a lower pressure than the air outside pretty amazing even more amazing when we Max it out [Music] this is a steel drum what we've done is we've put some water in it and we're heating it up to Boiling so there's nothing but hot air inside the drum this is an airtight cap which we use to seal the drum and now we cool the drum off hey Trevor give me a hand ready one two three lift [Music] that's good this pool is filled with ice what we're doing now is cooling off the steel drum which will cool off the air inside it which means eventually the air inside the steel drum will be a much lower pressure than the air outside the steel drum because this steel drum has a lot more volume than a 2-liter pop bottle it takes a lot longer for the air to cool down the other thing to think about is that it's a steel drum I could stand on it and it wouldn't even Dent but sure enough after a few minutes check it out the barrel has totally crushed the low pressure air inside the barrel wasn't enough to withstand the force of the regular air pressure that you and I walk through every day the air pressure all around us is enough to crush a steel drum how cool is that foreign powered Rockets have been working really well but we still want to go further two liter bottle work better than the water bottle we think increasing the size again might make it more awesome so now the plan is to switch our 2-liter bottle with a 20 liter water cooler jug and make a rocket out of that because the launcher nozzle which holds the bottle in place till we're ready to launch it isn't going to fit the opening of this bigger jug we've decided to use the cap that came with the jug if we screw the cap on it'll work sort of like the cork the air pressure will press down on the water and keep pushing against the cap until the cap has a catastrophic failure which is a very cool way of saying that eventually the cap will break and the bottle will shoot into the skies 20 liter water cooler jug filled with some water this is the cap that'll work sort of like the cork we put the air pressure in there the cap can't take it anymore pops off and the thing flies hopefully let's find out okay that looks good there let's do this go for pressure oh [Laughter] hilarious it worked pretty well it's uh it sort of does that I wonder if it's aerodynamic no no so how do we what else can we do to make it even more maxed out I think we've used the two liter bottles that work really well the cheerleader bottles were the best right I think so so what do we do we probably stock them if we stack them on top of each other yeah it worked I like that I'd still put a whole bunch of them together yeah tell you what I'll do you one better why don't we use three stacks awesome we'll use three stacks three launchers three times the thrust and we'll make a giant rocket at a two liter bottle yeah great idea high fives here we go all right gas molecules get further apart when you warm them up and closer together when you cool them down so what happens if you keep cooling them down while they turn into this this is liquid nitrogen nitrogen makes up 78 of the air we breathe but when you cool it down to minus 196 degrees Celsius it turns into a liquid it's boiling right now because at room temperature nitrogen wants to be a gas so the liquid nitrogen is turning into gaseous nitrogen and all of the extra molecules are escaping through the top of the bottle so what happens if I put a cap on the bottle right now the liquid nitrogen is turning back into a gas but because there's a cap on the bottle the gas has nowhere to go so the pressure is just going to keep building and building until the plastic bottle can't contain it anymore and and it pops like a balloon hence our Rockets have gone from small to bigger to even bigger now the plan is to use three two liter bottles and create Columns of them into a giant rocket we pressurize them just like we did before but with more thrust it might work even better even if it doesn't work better I'm pretty excited about this new plan giant rocket [Music] giant rocket you ready I'm ready okay glass Shields down connecting hose dialing up pressure pressure is rising it's bubbling bubbling 100 PSI okay stand by the fire three two one [Music] awesome yeah let's go check it out well there you have it rocket science Max experiments at large well done nicely nicely done do you think we could fire it again yeah it looks like it needs some repairs though well sir look that chemistry chemistry is the science of atoms and molecules the things that make up all matter and how they interact with each other take for example this glow stick actually don't take it because I I kind of need it the glow stick doesn't glow until you um the glow stick doesn't glow until you break the barrier and mix the two chemicals and they start to Glow huh pretty cool huh chemistry now the chemical reaction we're looking at today is the old vinegar and baking soda volcano but this reaction doesn't have anything to do with volcanoes it's chemistry now this experiment is totally safe but I do recommend you get an adult's permission before you do it because it's very messy uh yeah [Applause] First You're Gonna Want baking soda and vinegar these are your two main ingredients but you'll also want dish soap and red food coloring if you want it to look a little bit more like lava now I like to mix the baking soda red food coloring and dish soap together with a little warm water so all you have to do is add the vinegar and when you do this is what happens [Music] and there you go chemical reaction now I know what you're thinking you're thinking Phil how much vinegar or baking soda do I use well I'm not gonna tell you this is where you can be science maximites try different amounts more vinegar more baking soda more dish soap who knows write down the amounts each time you use it and find out what amounts work best that's called science and that's what we're going to be looking at today chemistry in all its forms and of course because it is science Max experiments at large we're going to max out the vinegar and baking soda volcano so I'm off to the Center for skills development and training come on hey telina hi Phil how you doing good how are you good this is teluna she's going for her PhD in chemistry for McMaster right yeah awesome which means you can help me max out the baking soda and vinegar we need you grab that vinegar and vinegar volcano so what happens when we mix these two chemicals well vinegar is an acid and baking soda is a base and when you mix them they neutralize each other to produce carbon dioxide and water as a byproduct so acids and bases are kind of like opposites yep so I guess that makes sense when you put them together crazy stuff happens yeah awesome chemistry okay so I want to use this much vinegar and this much baking soda what's with the fish tank the fish tank is where I want to mix it all together what do you think awesome maxed out okay uh let's move the fish tank somewhere where we won't make a huge mess sounds a little heavy with all that we get it no we're gonna have to we're gonna have to take a couple trips that's kind of heavy okay so we'll take this and that and then this and that no hold on I can do it one more okay good okay good yeah I took too much I took too much foreign [Music] put the sign in the background yeah in the BG I love the BG chemicals chemicals chemicals chemicals chemicals what ah chemicals are they things you have in a lab in a jar that's a chemical on them well yes but if that's all you think chemicals are then you need two no your chemicals burns out the stuff in the jar is a chemical but the jar itself also made of chemicals the table I'm putting it on made of chemicals my lunch chemicals roller skates chemicals my jacket chemicals these guitars chemicals my shoe chemicals this watch chemicals this fish chemicals chemicals chemicals chemicals chemicals meat chemicals you chemicals Ramona chemicals no I said your chemicals damn it never mind this is it the periodic table in the elements all matter in the universe is made up of these pure elements they go together in different ways to make up everything all matter think of it like building blocks these little atoms are some of the elements on this periodic table you got one oxygen two hydrogen bam you've got a water molecule one carbon two oxygen a it's carbon dioxide two carbon two oxygen four hydrogenous vinegar one sodium one chlorine a oh data in the universe is just the stuff I'm here combining into these and now you know your chemicals sugar [Music] let's take a closer look at what's going on when we mix vinegar and baking soda all chemicals are made of atoms there's only four types in our reaction carbon oxygen hydrogen and sodium when they go together like this a molecule of vinegar or acetic acid and this is a molecule of baking soda or sodium bicarbonate when Chemicals React they switch atoms that one goes there this one goes over here and then this one turns into this and then what you end up with are new molecules this one is called sodium acetate and this one is carbon dioxide gas the gas you breathe out and do you recognize this one right water H2O why all this happens gets complicated but the study of chemistry is all about how molecules are built and react with other molecules all right tellin are you ready yeah you're gonna pour all your baking soda in the fish tank and I'm gonna pour the vinegar into this bucket because you don't want to don't want to pour them together right away okay ready yep okay go for it when you're doing your PhD in chemistry you get to do stuff like this yeah really got to do a lot of fun reactions in the lab oh that's I'm I'm jealous have you ever done this much vinegar and baking soda in one time I can't say I ever have there you go that's what I like to hear I already put the soap in the bucket so it would mix with the vinegar when I poured it in are you done your baking soda already I'll pour faster smells vinegar it smells vinegar it makes me want french fries okay Celine you take this very full bucket of vinegar and dish soap thank you I will take this one oh we still have our third bucket okay I'm gonna I'll do these both at the same time okay ready on the count of three one two three [Applause] that's awesome so the one thing it didn't do it didn't shoot up in the air though yeah it's because the top is quite open so you would need to constrict it to get it to shoot up oh yeah because we're using just sort of a square a rectangular prism container we should get something that's maybe something more like our vinegar bottle right because there's lots of space down here but then it forces it into a tighter opening at the top there um like a volcano yep and what else can we do uh to make it even more powerful Max it out vinegar is only five percent acid the rest is water so you could try using a hundred percent so what kind of acid is vinegar it's acetic acid so vinegar is actually only five percent acetic acid and 95 water so you can get 100 acetic acid yeah can you get 100 acetic acid yes awesome why don't we get a container that's sort of shaped like a funnel like a volcano yeah and 100 acetic acid we'll do it again sounds good all right let's do it our vinegar and baking soda reaction went pretty well but now we're gonna try it with a much stronger type of the same kind of acid you find in vinegar carefully putting this down and watch out for the baking soda you never know when it'll get out and well I guess that's just baking soda yeah that's pretty safe yeah okay good so this is baking soda vinegar volcano version two we have this differently shaped glass what do you call this again that's an Erlenmeyer flask why is it called that it's actually named after a scientist did he look like that was he sort of shaped like this no no was he just a good chemist good scientist and I think he designed the glass oh see there you go so if you want to have a glass named after you be a good chemist and design a glass I want to make a fill Beaker so this is a hundred percent acid yeah and what's the difference between this and vinegar vinegar has five percent of this and 95 water but this is 100 so it's much stronger much stronger can you put this on your French fries no I wouldn't be putting it on your French fries no as chemicals go how dangerous is this it's not too dangerous but you definitely don't want to be breathing it in and you don't want to be eating it or getting it on your skin that's why I'm wearing these fancy fancy gloves so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pour the acetic acid in this What's this called that is a graduated cylinder because it finished at school so it graduated so you're going to mix water and food coloring and soap all together yeah and pour it into there it'll help dissolve some of the baking soda so hopefully it'll react better with the acid sounds good face protection oh all right that's good and now when we do it I want to add the funnel at the end to like accentuate the concentration of but I don't know if it's going to go so fast that I won't be able to get it in there but we'll try it try it vinegar baking soda volcano version two ah oh good thing you got the mask it smells a lot like vinegar it's really strong that was pretty good bro what what can we do to make it even bigger well you could try using a different chemical reaction oh okay like what the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide produces oxygen gas and so that one's pretty vigorous if you use a catalyst so we want something that makes a lot of gas so that it makes a lot of bubbles when you put the soap in it yep great let's do it and the sooner we leave that smell the better I think for my for my taste it's going to combine in a way that makes them very different from how they started out for example this is sodium or n a on the periodic table now the sodium tablets are in mineral oil because sodium reacts very strongly with water even the water in the air or especially the water in my skin watch what happens when I drop a sodium tablet into this Beaker of water very cool and very dangerous and this is chlorine or CL on the periodic table chlorine gas is very poisonous so what happens if we combine these two deadly substances do we create some sort of super poison something more deadly than anything else known to science that causes fear and Chaos in chemistry Labs all over the land no we create salt good old normal table salt these two substances combine to make n a c l salt something completely and totally safe chemistry oh we've gone from vinegar and baking soda to 100 acetic acid in baking soda and now we're doing the vinegar and baking soda volcano version three no longer vinegar and baking soda nope what are we using this time so here we have some hydrogen peroxide oh that's the stuff you use at home to put on a cut right yeah but the stuff at home is only three percent this one's 30. so much much stronger ten times stronger yes and is this more dangerous it's definitely definitely corrosive so wear your gloves corrosive means it could eat your skin it can burn your skin which is why we are wearing gloves and blast Shields what's going to mix with this so here we have some potassium iodide which is a salt and it's mixed in with some water the most important part of this reaction is the fact that it creates gas oxygen which makes bubbles when you put in dish soap right yep so one big squirt the dish soap like that and mix it up now we go over to the Blast Zone that's plenty all right [Laughter] now that's a reaction looks like there's steam coming off here why is that happening well it is an exothermic reaction so heat is being generated as the reaction proceeds oh cool can we lift our advisors now yep awesome and what's being released what's the gas that's coming off here so it's oxygen gas that's being produced oxygen ah what we want to do is make this even bigger but first can we do it again sure because I have an idea hold on I think we should repurpose our old volcano what do you think sounds like a good idea okay so if we put it over here all right volcano version 3.5 bit hydrogen peroxide potassium iodide right here we go looks like lava whoa [Laughter] look at that that now that is a big volcano eruption just covered the town that is completely that yes that town is going to be very clean because it's all soap bubbles it's the cleanest volcano this side of science maxaville so I still think we can do this bigger though right I agree um oh I know what if we use some sort of a tube like like maybe one of these right and then we attach it to like an air compressor I think you'd get some height yeah and we go outside the atom in 60 Seconds the atom is the smallest unit in a chemical element atoms are made of three parts part number one are these guys protons they have a positive charge the number of protons determines the element one is hydrogen two is helium three is lithium and so on the protons fit in the middle here which is called the nucleus they sit in here with part number two these guys they're neutrons and they have a neutral charge now I've got eight protons and eight neutrons in this nucleus making this an atom of oxygen orbiting around the nucleus are these tiny guys they're electrons and they have a negative charge I will demonstrate using kittens these are perfect because just like electrons kittens are really small and just like electrons kittens move around randomly you never know where they're going to be but an oxygen atom should have eight kittens or electrons somewhere inside these kittens are constantly escaping but guess what that happens with electrons too there you go the atom a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by randomly moving electrons cutest science ever how do you guys feel did you learn something huh pause up we learned something [Music] Talina and I have made a bunch of chemical reactions but in our quest to Max things out we've got a new plan hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide create gas one way to max out the reaction is to contain the gas in something like a tube we're gonna put the hydrogen peroxide in the tube first then we're going to put in the potassium iodide in the top through a one-way valve then we're going to pressurize the container when it finally reacts it will shoot up through the valve and we'll see how high we can get our stream of bubbles to go but be warned capping anything and not letting it Escape is never a good idea so we've got a release valve to make sure things work out this is one of those experiments that's definitely on the list of don't try this at home vinegar baking soda volcano version 4. hydrogen peroxide potassium iodide and what we're going to do this time is we're going to put it in this tube hydrogen peroxide goes in here and we've got Talina do you have the potassium iodide and syringes yeah two syringes full two syringes full about there is good and then soap good amount of soap in there and so what we're going to do is we're going to close this off and tighten it up and then we're going to pressurize the whole system and then we're going to add the potassium iodide and it's going to be spectacular we hope okay that's on tight this is all good putting this down here and potassium iodide goes in here ready puts down ready one two three go and we back away slowly yeah that's what I'm talking about okay let's check it out all right there you go vinegar and baking soda volcano Mexico thank you that was great if you guys want any instructions for the stuff that we've done today they're all on the website and thank you very much for watching science Max experiments at large we kind of need to clean up a lot don't we yeah we have out here we have the other room so tell you what uh you get a mop I will get the hose and a wheelbarrow for this"

        "transcription": "guys today we're going to do a science experiment with pencils and we're going to poke these pencils through this ziploc bag and the simplest bag will have water inside whoa oh ryan but that means all the water is going to leak through ryan that's what you think first let's put water inside the bag okay let's build it up hopefully ryan's telling me the truth because i don't want a big mess now we're going to put in food coloring for fun i'm going to use blue all right maybe one drop [Music] oh look at the colors of the ocean next up we're gonna need a sharpened pencil don't forget to ask your grown up for help all right here we go we're gonna poke it through three two is it gonna work yeah it's not gonna make a mess oh it's poking through whoa look the pencil is inside oh no way guys there's no water coming out what what is it like this how's it working whoa do more ryan okay i'm gonna do a bunch of pencils [Music] what about you try daddy can i do it all right let's see i'm gonna do it at an angle does it work whoa it works up down all right do it from opposite direction up down whoa it's working yeah it is well i'm gonna do more whoa oh [Music] whoa there's so many pencils all right i'm gonna keep going let's see if i can do all of them daddy what about we take out all the pencils and see what happens oh good idea let's put in the ball right all right see what happens well it's coming up there's so much water water water what are those whoa look at that well there's so much water coming out a shower it's a waterfall of water oh there's so much wow it almost filled up the whole thing thank you for watching our science video about pencils and poking through a bag hey guys today we're gonna grow our own rainbow all you need is a paper towel scissors markers and cups with water first using your paper towel you're gonna fold it in half and then we're gonna cut up one fourth don't forget to ask a grown-up for help and i have mommy here hi [Music] so first with any marker you want make a rectangle rot like this now let's color it in the next color in the rainbow is orange put it like this now let's fill it in next is yellow okay let's fill this in next is green fill it in green next up is blue we're gonna finish it off with my favorite color purple [Music] now do the same thing to the other side like this see like so next fill up your two thingies of water and the second one now take your rainbow paper that you drew and put half of both of the sides in the water [Music] now we wait let's watch the rainbow form look it's already forming a little bit [Music] well guys did you see we made our own rainbow whoa put it right here this is so cool did you see the marker guy move up the paper towel and touch each other because that's called capillary action did you know regular plants also use capillary action because they bring the water from the roots and make it go all to the other parts of the plants i hope you guys had fun making our own rainbow together bye remember always stay happy and rise up bye hi guys today we're doing a science experiment with skittles we're gonna see if skills color dissolves in water and i think it does [Music] now we're going to spread the skittles around like a circle on the plate i'm spreading all the different colors around like this all done look you can do it however you like because i made it like this and like this these are all the colors together next let's pour water onto the plate so ryan's using warm water so don't forget to ask a parent for help now we're going to see what happens it's already happening whoa look what's happening so cool so the more they are together the more bigger they are so what you notice is that the color is beating in the middle right yeah they are dissolving that looks cool [Music] whoa that is so cool [Music] and what did you notice is the color mixed together [Music] no look it's separated right yeah the colors did not mix only meet in the middle now let's try the other one and see what it looks like i think it's gonna those colors are gonna be really really big three two one that's enough what's happening um you know there's like a little toy thingy where it says this oh yeah it does [Music] three two one bye [Music] it looks so cool guys it does and look since we did different patterns they look differently the question was did the skittle colors dissolve in water yeah it did yeah the food coloring on the skittles and the sugar both dissolving water that's how we get really cool colors like those if skittles is all in water do m m's dissolve in water find out [Music] whoa that's so much on the mountains now let's spread them out on the plate [Music] like this i'm gonna make some of them big now i have two of them again i have one with a lot of colors and i have one that's random let's try so we're also using warm water so we're gonna try one with warm water and one with old water let's see it makes a difference or water right here [Music] starting yeah it is whoa so this is the m m so you guys see any difference between the m ms and the skittles yeah the m m's like twist it looks so do you cool like it's the same speed or you feel like a different speed it's different so you think it was going slower than the skittles or faster than the skittles i think faster than the skittles three [Music] [Applause] there you go guys m ms which one do you like better the m m's or the skittle one so we've been letting these sit out for a while so it looks super different everything is coming together there and here you guys look it's all the little m m pieces on the back it's all white now so instead of the color they're all white do you see because all the colors are coming out we got regular water for the sink and now we're gonna add ice to it to make it ice cold we're gonna let it wait for like one minute that's right ryan to make the water cold yeah okay i think it's ice cold now oh three oh [Music] while we wait do you guys think it's going to dissolve good question ryan what do you think do you think the cold water or the hot water just will help it dissolve faster i think the hot water will do a little faster okay let's check it out and see so we're going to wait it's working oh if you move it it goes faster wait and see what happens there's the cold water as you notice i think it's going a lot slower yeah we're waiting for a while now it's still working yeah it's just not going as fast [Music] what happens if you like blow it right question why don't you do it oh it doesn't change it just change the water [Music] wow it's mixing it all together whoa it's creating like a galaxy color [Music] wow that looks cool oh the other one looks cool when you mix you can try to blow that one too [Music] it's like a tornado when i blow it i know [Music] [Music] oh this is turning orange yeah this is the m m's here so it's because it's chocolate with the color dissolved you see the chocolate left over right yeah and it turned around yeah thank you so much for watching my video if you liked it then like and subscribe bye remember always stay happy and rise up bye guys then you guys can go out there and do your own science experiments right trying hot water versus cold water versus warm water trying skittles versus m m's and maybe there's other candies we haven't even thought of so much fun thank you for watching today we're gonna learn how important it is to watch your hands yeah so you know how long you're supposed to wash your hands for yeah how long you're supposed to sing happy birthday two times that's right so it's about 20 seconds at least okay so here's the experiment i want you to do this is water pour the water in there okay do it very very carefully [Music] you did help ryan so this is pepper any pepper you guys have this is the one that i have in the house okay so sprinkle some peppers in there yeah take turns sprinkle more you can do a lot more than that there you go next step is i want you to take your little finger dip it into the pepper water now i want you to pretend these pepper water or germs what happened when you take your hands out oh no there's germs yeah you see and if you touch it there's germs right look oh there's germs on your i know you see the germs yeah okay so here's why it's important to wash your hands you ready okay so that's what happened without soap it just sticks on your hand right germs everywhere next i want you to squirt soap into here there you go can you squirt some soap into there i hold for you there you go good all right cake turn there you go all right okay that's a lot here's what i want you to do take your little finger and then dip it into soap there you go dip in a lot okay so this is why soap is important [Music] first ryan's gonna do it okay go ahead whoa what happened the pepper's going away from the soap i know it looks like the pepper is running away from the soap right so think about it so if these are like germs and bacteria when you put your hands in soap and wash your hands right all the germs and bacteria are no longer on your hands yeah they're running away yeah of course it's my turn whoa that's so cool that's running away whoa that's so cool wow all right kate you want to try now okay guys it's my turn whoa it's running away too yeah isn't that cool yeah it's like oh that's why it's very important to wash your hands now we're gonna do it with glitter yeah so you guys can take each take a glitter or a share i want this glitter and put it into water and pretend these are germs there you go you're putting a lot of germs yeah a little bit okay a lot of germs for emma there you go and then we can all share oh cool kate there you go i'm adding some white germs now yeah different types of germs shake shake shake shake shake shake shake the glitter i mean shake their germs [Music] okay now let's try the power of the soap okay okay soap on okay then put it in wait it's going away moving away from your finger yeah it's like wait there was one right here and it was like poof yeah all right kate your turn dip it in there we gotta use we gotta use quite a lot of soap there you go good job girl [Music] whoa did you see how it separated yeah separated good all right that's so cool so now you learn why you should wash your hands it's time to wash your hands [Music] now it's time to wash my hands okay [Music] happy birthday to me happy birthday to me happy birthday dear me happy birthday to me happy birthday to me happy birthday to me happy birthday dear me happy birthday to me good job [Music] okay now take turns happy birthday to kate happy birthday two cakes happy birthday to cake happy birthday to kate happy birthday to me good job happy birthday to emma happy birthday to emma happy birthday to emma happy birthday to emma one more time happy birthday to emma happy birthday [Music] and that's how important it is to wash your hands and you should wash your hands too for at least 20 seconds hi guys today i'm going to microwave a bar of ivory soap and see what happens what do you think will happen ryan do you think it's gonna melt do you think it's gonna come bigger or smaller disappear what do you think disappear i guess we'll find out so what i want you to do first is i have water here and i want you to put the ivory soap into water and first we're gonna see if it's gonna sink or float okay okay do you think it's gonna sink or float maybe float okay let's try it [Music] it's floating yes there it is it actually floats in water we don't have other bars of soap but if you have a different brand you can see if it also stinks or float these are ivory brand so what does it mean when it floats on water more dense or less dense than water good job the bar of ivory's so floaty because it's less dense than water probably because there's lots of air holes inside okay so we're actually gonna cut it open and see okay i'm gonna cut the bar of soap in half all right so i cut it more if you examine it very closely it has like little holes of emptiness i guess it's where all the air is are you ready to microwave it yeah all right we got our new ivory barbed soap here put it in the microwave closing it start there we go all right we're keeping our eyes on the bar of soap make sure you use a microwavable safe plate okay let's see there's like stuff coming out of it and it's hard to see because you see that stuff oh i do see you guys see whoa keep your eyes on it look guys a little bit hard to see but look it's expanding yeah it's expanding by a lot whoa i think it's melting the soap or something whoa guys look that's big should we stop it it's gonna go all over their microwave whoa guys look at this whoa whoa it's like the whole microwave do you smell anything a little bit smells like soap yeah whoa it looks fluffy like marshmallows okay done okay only adults do this because it might be hot [Music] oh whoa did you expect that no so what happened it got melted and then it got bigger it expanded yeah yeah look super expanded look at that okay only don't touch this it might be hot whoa don't touch it yet okay it might be hot okay we're gonna wait for a little bit but just looking at it what does it look like toilet paper next you like uh scramble it a lot got it it looks like toilet paper to ryan kind of looks like whipped cream yeah let's see okay so safe to touch now ryan touch [Music] really yeah wow it's a little bit more rough yeah so this one actually only works with ivory soap but wait no i don't understand how does it work so why did the ivory soap expand in the microwave when it was made there are air that is trapped inside the mixture and because of the air that's why it floats in water so when you put the soap in the microwave the air and the water molecules that was in the soap starts to heat up vibrate and expand and spread further apart they push us against the rest of the soap molecules expanding the bar into a fluffy cloud blob do you guys like popcorn it works the same way water inside the kernel expands and pushes on the walls as it's being heated inside the microwave the water will turn into steam and expand and pushes along the wall of the curdle until pop the curdle explode and we have a yummy piece of popcorn that was so cool let's get back to ryan now emma wants to touch it yeah so emma this is soap apparently it's like coming apart oh you microwave it well because i wanted to show ryan how soap expands when you microwave it look see but it's almost my finger yeah but it's okay it's just soap we can go wash your hands okay isn't it cool yeah bye remember or stay happy and rise up bye"

to do a science experiment right here will you doing with me awesome let's see how we can get started hi I'm ma hi Ma I'm Trudy and welcome to OD kids the new learning playground hi Trudy nice to meet you nice to meet you so I heard that I could do a science experiment here and make elephant toothpaste we love elephant toothpaste and we've actually put together a scavenger hunt for you what that sounds so fun will you go on a scavenger hunt with me cool so how do I start you're all checked in and ready to go oh okay let's go check it out we're at the science lab for this science experiment we need to find six items in our scavenger hunt we need to find hydrogen peroxide saf de goggles dish soap food coloring measuring cups and yeast okay can you help me look for these items great let's go wow mind gym wo this must be a room for your mind wow this is so cool I recognize some numbers here will you count with me okay we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 9 10 wow that's so fun oh okay I don't see any items yet for our science experiment H oh what's this A it's kind of like a musical instrument see all these different colors oh look there's little items in here that you can find oh looks like a balloon and a little fuzzy ball oo this is fun cool hydrogen peroxide we found our first item for our science experiment hydrogen peroxide can help heal a cut but you do not want to get this in your eyes so we need to find safety goggles okay okay good job we have our first item check it out a word find so this big puzzle has a bunch of words in it but they throw other letters in it to mix it all up so it's kind of hard to see the words see if you can find any words in here you have to look really close oh I found one look p e a o pear ooh that's a really yummy fruit any other words that can maybe give us a clue to the things that we're looking for oh what about this word safy safety like safety goggles maybe there are safety goggles around here oh look there's some letters down here do you know what letter this is it's the letter M for Ma and it's one of my favorite colors the color yellow we did it we found safety goggles safety goggles are really important when you do experiments because they protect your eyeballs all right two items down four to go safety goggles and hydrogen peroxide all right let's keep looking wo it's like a grocery store or a market in here look at all of this play food oh cool it looks like it's organized by color I see green and orange and yellow oo what is in here a cucumber slice I love cucumbers oh and a green apple that's a nice healthy fruit and one of my favorite vegetables brocc ooh and a tomato slice these are all really healthy foods yeah fruit and vegetables they have nutrients and vitamins in there so they're what I like to call an all the time food they help you grow ooh what's this some pizza hey let's see if we can find anything that we need for our science experiment wo this is like a little restaurant or a diner o don't mind if I do put a little ketchup on here M pretty tasty see if there's anything in here [Music] I found yeast we need yeast in our science experiment if you add warm water to yeast it helps things rise in fact you need yeast to make red that's right hey we are doing a great job on the scavenger hunt let's put this with our other things and then we can keep looking for more items for our experiment good job let's keep looking okay let's keep looking for more items for our science experiment wo there's a lot of fun things in here come over [Music] here look at these Big Blocks huh let's see what can I make here okay hm ah feels pretty sturdy it could be a new chair and put this on it and this or it could be a throne Queen Hama I still don't see anything for our science experiment hm maybe there's something over here hey check it out do you know what shape this is that's right it's a circle and it's the color green let's see if I can hula hoop let me try again Ready Set hula hoop hula hoop oh that was a little bit better look you can also put it on your arm like a giant bracelet and Swing Swing Swing Swing but you know what this is not something that we need for our science experiment fun though oh this is a really cool game look you have a spinner and it tells you where to put your body on the dots let left foot yellow see left foot yellow H left foot yellow let's see if I can do one more turn on here this is left hand green whoa you have to try not to fall down mine might fall down soon that's okay all right H come over [Music] here wo do you know what this is It's a bottom of a slide should I go down the slide okay oh wow it looks like it's really high up I wonder if there's anything at the top that we can use for our science experiment I can't wait to make elephant toothpast face it says socks only that means I need to take my shoes off all right let's oh they go in these Cubbies over here all right I'm going to go to the top and see if I can find something for our experiment see you at the bottom hi bye I think I see something for our experiment I'll see you soon wo look what I found dish soap we definitely need this for our experiment I'm so excited thanks for your help all right I'm going to grab my shoes and our other items for our experiment and we can keep looking we have two more to find come on hello let's keep looking cool clock wa look over here it says a r t art this is an art space cool look at this big piece of paper oh I could color something on here ooh look at all of these mark markers I'm going to choose purple because it's one of my favorite colors all right let's see what should I draw ooh I know see if you can [Music] guess it's a science flask you can use this in a science experiment but it kind of looks like something else what do you think okay I'll give you a hint do you know [Music] now it's two eyes and a nose what else does it need oh right a mouth give it a big mouth big smile hello oh there's crays too maybe I could put something else on here and choose a different color let's see um I found the food coloring look oh and it's my two favorite colors purple and yellow we're getting closer and closer to finding everything we need for our science experiment one more item to find come on wo hey look at this hello cool bee wow it looks like this bee is measuring something hey Mr be I like your style purple and yellow two of my favorite colors hey it looks like we even have the same kind of [Music] shoes measuring cups that's the last thing we need for our science experiment we found everything let's head into the science lab come on hey Trudy hi Ma welcome back thank you I think that I found all of the items I need for the science experiment yay may I see them oh yeah I have safety goggles hydrogen peroxide dish soap food coloring yeast and measuring cups congratulations Ma you are ready for the experiment wow really you go oh thank you so much an official lab coat awesome enjoy thank you I'm so excited to do this [Music] experiment okay everyone safety first if you're doing this experiment at home please make sure to do it with a grownup we are going going to make elephant toothpaste but remember it's not really toothpaste so please don't use it on your elephants the first step is we need to pour half a cup of hydrogen peroxide into this glass okay and be nice and careful and pour it to the top okay step one complete second we need our dish soap okay squirt of dish soap in there and you swirl it around make sure it mixes a little bit together okay that looks pretty good and now I'm going to add two of my favorite colors purple and yellow okay get a little goop there it looks black but once it all mixes together it's going to look purple and yellow and look the yellow looks orange but once it comes out of the cup it's going to look yellow [Music] okay all right next we are going to add our yeast to some warm water and I already have some warm water right here and you only need one teaspoon so let me open this up can get one teaspoon of yeast [Music] okay there we go one teaspoon add it to the water and stir it around see it's all mixing together okay and then we're going to add it to the glass and hopefully we will see our toothpaste in [Music] action it's going to the top whoa that's so cool wao did you see some of the colors wow it really looks like toothpaste science is so much fun Isn't that cool wo it's still going wo oh there are the colors right there a that was so fun hey thanks for helping me find all of those items for our science experiment you are very helpful science is so fun and we had a lot of fun today right we went on a scavenger hunt we did a word puzzle oh I went down a really cool green slide and there was a

foundation in Los Angeles California and here you can adopt a dog or a cat and then they can be part of your family there's a dog right there Hi am hi I'm Megan Hi Megan nice to meet you nice to meet you too this is Willow oh hi Willow oh It's always important to ask before you pet an animal uh can I pet Willow yes you can so just Crouch down so you're on her level and put your fist out so she can smell you Willow Willow what do you think a so sweet well are there more animals inside there are oh let's go check them out so what is this little one's name this is Sprout Sprout what a cute name hi

play with us a wa cool squeaky toy it's a pink snake so once someone adopts an animal what do they need to take care of the animal yeah so for dogs they need a leash a collar a harness um food bowls uh and a lot of toys wa food bowls toys it's a lot of work to take care of an animal they need a lot of things a and is it different for cats yeah so cats would need um also food bowls uh litter box litter um some good things to scratch on oh yeah cats love to scratch and a safe carrier in case you need to take them to the vet oh wow so you get a lot of things once you adopt an animal here yes yes we give people some of the food that they've been eating um some toys and where do you get all of these toys they have so many fun things to play with here we get a lot of it donated people have extra supplies they donate them to us and yeah it's a big help for us wa what a great idea to donate toys for these dogs and cats to play with oh what's this toy where did these animals come from so we rescue these animals from City shelters uh basically the shelters are crowded with animals so we take them and find them new homes oh that's really nice and if someone wants to adopt an animal what do they do so we would have them come in and meet some of the animals they'd fill out an application and we would help them find the right animal that matches their family wow that's awesome it's so fun to play with cats and dogs but it's also important to remember you have to take very special care of them wo come look at this dog wo what kind of dog is this this is an American Bully mix

part of our family oh cats and dogs are so cool well this is the end of this video but if you want to see more of my videos all you have to do is search for my name will you spell my name with me cool m e e k a h ma well thanks for learning with me see you next time bye hi it's me Ma and today we're at nailed DIY studio in Orlando Florida DIY means do it yourself and today we're going to build and make art I can't wait come [Music] on wow look at all of this stuff these are all signs that people have made and that's what I get to make today oh look this box says meow oh I wonder if it's something that you could put cat treats in or cat food oh and look at this one all guests must be approved by the dog that's really funny oh I see some paint colors down here let's see how many colors they have a lot oh I wonder if they have two of my favorite colors do you know what they are oh they're purple and yellow and they're right next to my best friend bpp's favorite colors blue and orange H that's cool wow these are all the different wood pieces that you can use to make art oh look at this one it's pretty small so you can have a small sign that says welcome or whoo look at this this giant rectangle could make a really cool sign and it could hold a lot of words maybe it could say something like Welcome Friends come on inside for snacks and games and good times we love our friends welcome and here's a square one two three four even sides and there's bigger squares up there H oh cool a circle a small circle and a really big circle H which one should I choose uh I think I like this one the medium stack square that's number 07 we have to remember that 07 okay come on oh hi Margie oh hi M Hi how are you good how are you I'm pretty good I'm excited to make art today awesome so did you pick a size yes number 07 perfect and did you want to add anything to that oh um oh maybe that silver hook right there okay oh and can I also have that bow tie for my best friend absolutely so we have your station set up over here you ready to get started yeah let's do it all right let's go all right let's go go okay we have everything we need we have lots of cool paint two of my favorite colors purple and yellow oh well this one's called dandelion fancy and we have Pearl and Latte we also have a paint roller easily put on the paint and we have some sponges we have have silver Hooks and we have our Crown stapler our power stapler and the stacked wood piece that I picked out see it's actually four little pieces and when they're stacked together it makes one beautiful square and what are these for so these are actually to hold the wood stack pieces together oh okay makes sense so what's the first thing we need to do so your first step is to put a line of glue on each one and then flip them over okay I think I can do that [Music] okay now what so we have these lines here and those are actually where you are going to put the Staples oh so these lines it's like a little guide exactly so first we are going to put our safety glasses on oh right if we're going to use a power tool we need to be nice and safe and remember only use a power stapler if you are with a [Music] grownup wow you're really good at that think you can do that yeah all right so I'm going to follow the black lines that's my [Music] guide all right good teamwork you are a you did good thankk you all right so now you're going to flip it over and there you have it look at this perfect square what's the next step so the next step is we're going to take it to the sanding station where you're going to make it smooth ooh let's make it smooth come on so this is the sander okay what you're going to do is put one hand here one hand under here there is a power button that you want to push once it's on you are going to run it over the whole thing until it's as smooth as a piece of paper oh all right well why do you want it super smooth it helps the paint stick to the wood oh okay so let's make this super smooth time to [Music] sand so we are going to choose your base color so we're going to look at your stencil yes I can't wait to see all right so this is the sensil we have for you wow look at this an ice cream cone one of my favorite sweet treats and that's my name and my headband oh and this is going to be my bag and this other stencil will help make it really look like my bag oh I love it okay so for the base um I'm thinking purple yes that is a good color okay so I can just put it everywhere yep so you're just going to squeeze that over the top of the wood [Music] okay okay and I get to use this really fun paint roller to spread it all over the wood so you're going to paint the top and then all of the [Music] sides all right now we just wait for it to dry actually we have a way to dry it quicker oh how so we are going to use this blow dryer you've probably seen a blow dryer before is to dry your hair so there is that you are going to blow dry it on the base setting okay cool is it ready ready to go okay turn it to base and let's [Music] dry okay you're dry wow okay now what oh it is dry cool so now what you want to do is sand it until it's smooth again so that we can put the stencil on okay this time I'm going to give you a piece of sandpaper as well so you can sand over the top of it nice oh cool it's purple sandpaper and it's really r rough but this rough piece of paper will make this smooth hey those are opposites rough and smooth bobby pin all right like this so you're going to go back and forth over the whole thing just like that yes [Music] perfect okay all right so your board is nice and smooth we are ready for the stencil yes all right right so the stencil has a couple of layers we are going to peel the white layer off first oh it's like a giant sticker yes all right so I'm going to hand you one side okay and we are going to center it on your board together I think that looks good what do you think I think it's pretty good yeah okay so we're just going to stick this on okay I'm going to give you a squeegee a squeegee I know what that is this is your squeegee yeah what you want to do is run it over the whole thing and you see how it turns a little bit darker M that's how you know it's really stuck to the wood cool and this is going to push all the bubbles out yes [Music] okay bye bubbles so now that it's all stuck to the wood what I want you to do is peel this top layer off okay actually going to start from over here ah and pull down towards you slow and low Slow and Low my favorite way to go oh wait oh come on [Music] sticker W I did it wow that looks cool already all right so now we're ready to paint yes all right so H I'm going to start with the ice cream cone and I'm going to use Pearl that way it would look like vanilla one of my favorite flavors so what you want to do is dip the wide end of the sponge that end of the sponge into the paint okay take a look at it does it look wet yep that's too much paint oh no so what you want to do is dab it off and you can use the paper or you can use the plate okay I'll dab on the plate there all right look at it now does it look wet nope you're good to go so now you're going to just dab up and down okay over the whole thing like this and is it okay if it gets on the blue part yes it is okay it's a stencil so that part is going to come off all right so let's cover this ice cream [Music] cone oh K perfect so now you can pour your next color for for the cone oo and The Cone I'm going to make that latte you look like a sugar cone I'm going to be careful cuz I don't want it to get on the top of the ice cream cone but even if it does we can always fix it oh you know what I like your attitude Margie okay that cone's looking pretty tasty yes it is all right so what color did you want to paint your name oh my name I want it to be yellow yes I love it all right so let's go ahead and pour the yellow okay yellow there wide end dab dab dab you got it oh yeah now I'm feeling like a pro over [Music] here now let's see my headband is yellow so I'll just use the same [Music] yellow Margie what happened I need two more colors for my bag you're right do you know what colors are on my bag yep blue and orange all right so go ahead and pick the blue and orange that you want okay down there oh this is good and oh this ooh yeah this will look cool okay do we need the other stencil yet or no not yet so what we're going to do with this is once we peel this up we'll put this one on so it really makes it look like your back awesome so I should start with this one I [Music] think dab dab dab and get the whole bag Perfect all right so take a look at it do you like it like that or do you want to do another coat oh I think I like it like that perfect so we are going to give this one good blow dry again okay and then we're ready to peel all right let's do it so this time you are going to blow dry on the stencil setting and just be careful it is powerful we don't want everything flying away okay I'll be careful here we [Music] go that is powerful it's dry so now it is reveal time oh okay you ready yeah so we're going to turn it this way because we want to peel the stencil Against the Grain oh okay do you know what wood grain is uh you can explain it no C so the wood grain are the lines that you see in the wood oh that's right yeah so if the if the lines of the wood are going this way we want to peel this way oh gotcha Against the Grain exactly so you're going to start with one corner and then peel down down towards you towards this corner or each down towards you so yes all right let's see how it looks W whoo uh-oh there's a little piece stuck that's okay it can rip it can tear that's totally fine there we go wo that looks so cool how good you did WOW check it out so now we are ready to put the other part of your bag on oh that's right we have another stencil so I'm going to do the same thing I'm just going to peel the backing off and we will Center it together okay it good looks good to me okay all right ready let's commit oh we did it you're ready for your paint oh all right let's get the orange on [Music] there I think that looks pretty good okay do you remember what comes next we have to dry it yes okay okay now what setting should I put it on so you're going to be on the stencil setting makes sense here we go is powerful there you go everything's about to fall no okay so do you remember the wood lines oh yes you want to go against the grain yes so we want to go this way correct okay there's my bag it looks so good oh oh this is so so cool so now I just need two hooks because I want to be able to hang my headband and my bag all right so we have the hooks right here okay I'm going to have you pick two hooks out of there yep two hooks okay we have one two so we are going to be using a power tool again okay so we need our safety glasses you know safety first so I will drill the little holes to get the hooks started and then you'll screw the hooks in sounds good let's put this one right here [Music] okay okay you're ready for the hooks two holes and here we go so I can just twist them in right correct [Music] almost there there we go it's finished wow look at the sign I love it so much thank you Margie for all your help and helping me make this awesome MAA sign you are so welcome well I

today we're gonna put our trolling and then make it float on water so this is very easy all you need are some markers [Applause] a plate and some warm water first you want what you want on the plate but I'm gonna make stick figures with multiple arms plus so like this and make it really thick [Music] Ness we make arms and then make the legs so after you make your drawing and warm water on the side still he moved or keep dancing oh big arms too oh I feel like the arms or leg is gonna break oh it's moving now yay now he can just walk dude [Music] there you go this is easy way to make your stick figure float s he broke this is so cool you can hold it okay guys for the next one I'm gonna make a dog it should be like this yeah I can put like ears I feel like I'm making a cat I'm making a big dog or a cat oh I can't do it right it looks like you like this I put an R okay then I'll make the legs and the arms I feel like I'm making like a super strong cat or something okay without letter here and then I'm going to make this red and I'll make the eyes red on the ears okay so I'm coloring the pants he has jeans okay I'm gonna make the skin color purple [Music] here and I'm gonna put this part green okay like this and perfect okay guys let's see it float okay that's good we're missing one leg oh no the other leg broke off you can run away though his arm no no oh oh no my dog bro that's okay let me show you some cool ones that worked roll the clip [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] I hope you guys enjoyed watching us do drawing float hey guys what do you think would happen if we put a balloon on a bed of nails so you guys if you do this at home make sure you ask your parents for help all right so today I'm in charge Ryan yeah so what do you guys think do you think the balloon's gonna pop or stay the same on top yeah on top of this Nails instead of trying out with a lot of nails let's do it with one let's see what happens I think it's gonna pop if you put a lot of pressure all right let's see what happens you guys ready yeah all right same pressure [Music] all right so guys so now let's try the same thing with a lot of nails yeah guys remember there are a lot of nails so remember as for grown up for help right so you don't want to touch it here all right you guys ready so set balloon I think I know what's gonna happen but and I'm gonna use this board so you won't go anywhere ready and press it good guys I'm pressing really hard but it's still not popping you see it how come there's so many nails Daddy but it didn't pop the first time we apply the force into one nail so the area that we apply the force is very tiny area right here okay the second time we apply same amount of force but this big of area for example if I press you with my finger ow right so then same amount of force but if I do it with my palm doesn't hurt right no but I'm applying the same Force but in different areas but Daddy can we see how much force it takes to pop the balloon with the giant area all right let's see because earlier we couldn't pop it that it was like all the way down here if I press it on my 100 force what's gonna happen are you doing 100 no not yet oh my gosh it's still not popping do I have a pop no way it's still not popping are you at 100 yet yeah oh my gosh you ready I'm gonna reach my hundred percent you ready oh yeah still no pumping look at this look at that wow oh that looks hard but did you see how much force I applied yeah because every year was so much bigger so I have that place a lot bigger Force to pop the balloon that was so cool so now we're gonna see it in action again all right let's go whoa okay I'm pressing a lot oh you have to back down again yes still no whoa wow almost all the way down [Music] that was so cool yeah this experiment teach you the concept of the pressure the pressure is among the force applied over the area so the smaller the area is the higher the pressure for example with the same amount of force by applies in smaller area it makes the pressure higher so say my mother but they're the one that your point of pressing with your finger it's higher pressure than the one you're pressing with your hands yeah today I'm doing the Freezy animal challenge mommy put a shark inside this balloon and this balloon is filled with ice and I'm gonna have to free the shark from the balloon and first here's how mommy did it first grab a balloon then get your favorite toy carefully put the toy inside the balloon did I mention carefully once the toy is inside fill the balloon with water oopsie carefully not to splash water everywhere the balloon will get bigger and bigger then remove it and put it on the tray next tie the balloon so the water won't spill out everywhere next put the balloon in the freezer until the water inside becomes ice okay first I'm gonna try to get rid of the balloons and also don't forget to ask a grown-up for help I have Mommy here hi cool what it's not breaking it's super strong I'm gonna take the balloon off and you won't even see it wait guys I think I see the shark inside somewhere in the ice first I have my goggles just in case okay let's get started [Music] we already cracked it yeah I see the shark already but I'm gonna try to use warm water who's working [Music] it almost got the shark out he's right there put his fit in his tail is stuck I think that I can use salt bam no I hear the ice crackling guys I think it's working I don't want the shark to crackle I think I have an idea Mr shark Let's Take It Outside remember oh it only do this with adult supervision okay three two one you just got out [Applause] can I take him out well no not yet his tail is still stuck [Applause] got the shark thank you for rescuing Mr shark with me hey guys today we're doing the marshmallow in a vacuum experiment that's right guys so we have some giant marshmallow got some regular sized Marshall mallow got some funny bunnies and chick marshmallows and here we just have a container and yeah so when you put it in here what's gonna happen is it's got the device here and all the air will be sucked out so then when you have no more air it creates a vacuum so before we begin I want to ask you guys what do you think will happen Ryan when you put the marshmallow in the container and suck out all the air I think the marshmallow will you think so maybe you're right maybe if there's no air it'll be all dried up so it would be smaller or bigger it'll be squished or expand smaller yeah okay what do you guys think okay so let's test it out here first let's start with regular sized marshmallow you wanna try that yeah so we're gonna open up let's put like three okay and then you'll be fun you can also make faces on the marshmallow so here you do a face and I do a face okay okay just see what happened to it bam face okay well Ryan's finishing up I'm gonna do mine what should we draw guys you know I'm not sure how it's gonna be in the vacuum so maybe under our little eyes little eyes and then maybe a sad face just so I can draw a sad face with one hand oh harder than I thought guys there it is sad little marshmallow it has e on the top uh-huh and it has the face and then it has l o l and then oh LOL what is L for l o l e okay [Music] thank you sorry about my hairy face hairy face here it's not Halloween Mommy right so I'm gonna put this on top okay close it up tight and this gonna suck out all the air so you're gonna put this and press the button [Music] does it do it fast take your time it's probably hard to tell [Music] you're gonna go over here [Music] do I see or not see I'm sucking all the air as we speak and here was the original marshmallow you guys can't tell so Ryan what did you notice this was the regular marshmallow and then here is the one in the vacuum so actually feels like they got bigger it got bigger it expanded yeah yeah so there it is it actually got bigger so here's what's gonna happen when you unsuck the air you ready can you open this okay if you press this button all the air will go back okay [Music] all right so you guys notice here it's kind of it's the same size okay all right go ahead vacuuming itself vacuuming you guys yeah [Music] okay Ryan's gonna press the button again from three two one we're a little smaller again so what actually happened with the marshmallow in the vacuum that it became bigger oh but do you know why he got bigger why if you're sucking out all the air why does it become bigger hmm [Music] hypothesis and me because Siri the air is gone that the air is gone because the air is gone yeah okay guys so here's what's actually going on did you know that there are air bubbles inside the marshmallows that moves around and pushed out onto the marshmallow there are also air pressure from the atmosphere outside pushing in to the marshmallow oh the air from inside the marshmallow pushing out versus the air from the outside pushing in this battle of the air keeps the marshmallow at the same constant size you see now however when you take out all the air outside of the marshmallow away then the air inside of the marshmallow that's pushing out when that means the marshmallow will expand and become bigger however when you let the air back inside now the outside air will push back onto the marshmallow again oh it becomes normal sized marshmallow again okay so now we're gonna try with giant sized marshmallow giant sized marshmallows okay here's the cap okay so oh wait can we take one out that way we can see the original size yeah okay so we're actually going to keep one ounce so I can see this I see same size right now three two one [Music] one of them's gonna reach the top reach the top oh yeah there's some space up there oh do you guys see look it's getting so much bigger you see [Music] that's crazy look that's the original jumbo size and that's the super jumbo size wait when we make it bigger it uh and one of them or two of them is up against the roof so it's like oh so it's gonna stay like that when you put it back let's see what happens okay let's see three two one small mode whoa whoa you see that yeah that was really cool yeah it's so cool okay now bunnies are you guys ready to be jumbo size and then small outside okay we're gonna try one big bunny [Music] maybe two big bunnies wait this is white oh what happened there's no space on top yeah there's no space on top already that's the fun of the experiment to see what happens okay three two one yeah can it become bigger it's getting bigger do you guys see it's becoming bigger oh yeah it is look they're getting closer together oh bam I know they're touching now they're friends now they're all friends okay Ryan you ready to let the air back in you can't see me through this now you can whoa you guys see that all right guys instant replay now you see now you also see okay we're gonna put these all together oh and baby bunnies boom and some baby chicky chicks okay guys we're gonna put it on bam and then we put No Air vacuum vacuum the air out vacuum the arrow air the vacuum out oh okay it got bigger [Music] yeah it's adding a little bit bigger the original bunny oh did you get bigger oh yeah I got a lot bigger yeah I got a lot bigger oh yeah here's the original chick here it's kind of a lot bigger too because you when you see it expand you see the little cold and cracks yeah see when it's trying to expand you guys see the little cracks that it makes should we put the air back yeah put it back let's see how small it goes let's see oh yeah that's crazy okay I'm gonna try it one more time you ready okay I'm gonna do it super still okay okay I got it press it for me [Music] whoa [Music] do you see it expand look it's starting to get some cracks oh yeah see the cracks guys okay undo it whenever you're ready okay and cracks no cracks whoa that was so cool yeah and here's the recap of Wyatt Row the clip did you know that they are air bubbles inside the marshmallows that moves around and pushed out onto the marshmallow there are also air pressure from the atmosphere outside pushing in to the marshmallow oh the air from inside the marshmallow pushing out versus the air from the outside pushing in this battle of the air keeps the marshmallow at the same constant size you see now however when you take out all the air outside of the marshmallow away then the air inside of the marshmallow that's pushing out winds that means the marshmallow will expand and become bigger however when you let the air back inside now the outside air will push back onto the marshmallow again so it becomes normal sized marshmallow again thank you for watching my marshmallow in a vacuum experiment so we got a whole bunch of rock candy here have you guys ever tried rock candy before yeah yeah you have yeah how about you guys you want to try it yeah okay so which flavor you want to try I want this one okay so Emma wants to try blue Kate wants to try grape and Ryan is her nipples green apple okay some green apples some blade [Music] [Applause] [Music] yeah he doesn't try it and you don't have to chew you just put it in your tongue and it's supposed to pop tell me if you feel the pop do you I feel it I hear it too do you feel the pop yeah just put it in your tongue and then just keep it there and close it close your mouth maybe popping whenever I eat it and I only do this I feel I'll hear a lot of Pop I know wow what'd you guys think you guys like it don't like it weird you like it how about you guys [Music] okay you guys ready to blow up some balloons okay actually before we try to pop a balloon we're gonna see what it looks like with the coke okay so everybody pour in their rock candy all of them yeah all of them there's a lot of green I know yeah okay so now we're gonna try the Diet Coke in there and see what it looks like whoa whoa that's a lot well we want to eat it I know we have a lot more whoa I don't know if we need that much wait there's like it's like kind of changing different colors you see the pop in there yeah maybe we're adding too much you guys do you guys hear the popping sound oh yeah oh popping out more [Music] do you see the popping thank you Mommy how does it taste it tastes good it doesn't yeah okay just one little taste thumbs up it kind of tastes like one percent of the taste of Sour Patch really yeah sour interesting okay yeah okay so now we're really gonna do this experiment okay first you're gonna take your balloons [Music] change your mind okay yeah so first that's right good job Ryan yeah all right we have a funnel to the balloon our Ryan's gonna put the rock candy inside like that both because we are courageous yeah yeah go big or go home right yeah oh bigger oh there's a lot yeah all right [Applause] okay right here's for the hard part can you put your balloon over this without it going in yeah you got it you got it got it Kate's turn oh okay there you go okay [Music] yes your turn Emma okay now Emma's turn of course we need two yep we're gonna try two probably works with one but maybe we can get a bigger balloon right down three two one go whoa whoa he's so big and I still see yourself yeah mine is more bigger yours have a weird shape Ryan yeah my ears working now it's going down oh no it's going down here [Music] yeah wow oh it's Billy that's why we have a tray it's filling a little bit but it's okay that's why we have a tray I want to taste it okay okay well we're done we can open it you can taste it hey guys today we're gonna do a science experiment and see what happens when we put these eggs in liquids we prepared so many different kind of liquid we got Diet Coke vinegar coffee coffee juice orange juice and water eggs are made up of a similar material as your teeth we're gonna put the eggs in each cup with the different liquids so we can test out and see what happens to the teeth if you don't brush it this one's just vinegar we're gonna pour vinegar all right here we go daddy's gonna pour vinegar oh yeah it does smell like a vinegar all right perfect next is Coke pour this in two probably okay all in next is orange juice oh I smell it and the next one is coffee next one is coffee all right here we go [Music] all right last is water out of the way and good job now we're gonna wait wait one day see you soon [Music] it's been one day now and now we're gonna check what happened to the eggs now we're gonna start out with water actually touch it oh it's the same so the exact same yeah you can put your teeth in a wall in water for a day nothing happens okay so water is good for you next let's look at the egg and coffee oh yeah I drink coffee all the time so this is my tea oh if I go brush my teeth look at this what happened to the egg Ryan it changed the colors look at it so what happened if you don't brush your teeth after you drink coffee and brown I know no more white this is what a normal egg looks like and this is what an egg and coffee looks like ew no now let's try orange juice Orange right color let me see what oh you see the bubbles that are on it yeah but besides that same right don't forget there's sugar on there too so if you leave it for a while it might attract bacteria and germs now we're gonna try soda or cook oh yeah we hear all the story about soda let's see soda also have lots and lots of sugar no it also stains the egg wow wait so this is like a super good version this is the second best version this is the worst the worst version no more white teeth right nice this is the most exciting One vinegar all right let's see take it out Ryan take it away what you gotta be gentle feel it feel it oh it's soft what happened Michelle vinegar is very acidic so it actually dissolves the shell oh it's gone Ryan oh you left it's gonna explode it's like a bouncy egg you dare to bounce really yeah it does oh it's actually pretty bouncy you guys you can bounce it no do it I'm scared it doesn't burst huh so maybe we should have kept it in there a little bit longer it only been a day so maybe you need two eggs so there it is the shell there so right probably bounced a little bit too much but if you leave it in for two days it's actually more bouncy wow so now you know what happens to vinegar what does it do it dissolves all right guys clean up time we're back we cleaned up we got new gloves right and then Ryan learned not to touch raw eggs right yeah Ryan also go wash his hand already so now soda was brown we're gonna test it out to brush it yeah to see if it has any effects okay yeah yeah make sure you put the toothpaste on oh teamwork and I'll be my toothbrush okay ride coating gloves so maybe that's why it's a little bit hard yeah that's good there we go Brushy Brushy Brushy Brushy Brushy Brushy ten hours later oh we're seeing if it well well I can tell already does brushing help make your teeth whiter so oh yeah yeah Ryan look it's already getting less brown on the spot that you're brushing you guys see oh look at it oh it's already the difference this is the regular spot and this is where we brushed it oh yeah yeah wow the importance of brushing your teeth right everybody's brushing the toothbrush everyone's brushing more to see oh yeah I can tell the difference good job Ryan whoa you see the difference yeah I can tell it's nice so what did you learn Ryan uh brushing your teeth helps a lot yeah I died and how many times a day you're supposed to brush your teeth at least two two times a day good for how long do you know two minutes two minutes yeah easy to remember hi guys so today we're going to be using 10 different vegetables or fruits and we're gonna see if they can power this alarm clock so we have potatoes apples of avocados Tomatoes mangoes lemons bananas strawberries grapes and watermelons first we're gonna try the classic potato it was made for potatoes so I think it's gonna work three two one oh so if you notice here look at the alarm clock this is it working yet oh yeah we got this kit online so it comes with a magnesium wire and a copper wire you have to connect this too is this uh-huh hi yeah and here all right you tell me is the alarm clock working look it's working yeah it turns on it's got enough energy yeah so we have to manually set it but you know there it is a potato works I'm gonna use a potato for my alarm clock tonight next I'm gonna test out the Apple and do the opposite on the other one yes like all right go Moment of Truth does it work it works yay so an apple can also power it on you know it's true because look what happened when I take out one okay if I take out one and stop working but if I plug it back in it works I'm really interested for this one the avocado guys let us know if you think avocado can power on the alarm clock oh I think it's gonna work you think so yeah you guys notice right now nothing's on right so it doesn't work right now so Ryan's going to put it in can you use an avocado alarm clock tonight items what I'm supposed to put this that's right yeah supposed to be opposite you need that to complete a circuit does it work avocado whoa now the most interesting one is warm up that's true that one we're not sure tomato wait no I think tomato will work tomato will work okay let's see now we'll try Tomatoes they're really messy don't poke it too hard I'm like this does it work it works it does work wow maybe we do need just fruits and vegetables do you think fruits and vegetables can power on your iPad oh that's a fun experiment to do later okay now let's try mango it's bending the wire here and then one yeah so you need the other part to make like a circle you have to complete the circuit that's why you need it actually it works by converting chemical energy into electrical energy did you know that the energy doesn't actually come from the potato but rather the energy comes from the metal dissolving inside the potato the energy made from the reaction moves to the Copper strip down the wire and into the clock making the clock turn on that's spectacular oh here we go yeah wow everything works so far which one you want to try next the banana one that's interesting I think it'll work you think so I think cast energy [Applause] now let's try banana I'll try it like this okay thank you so it's easier to do positives and negatives wow well yeah doing a different time but yeah oh it does work yay you can have a banana clock now let's try it what do you think Ryan the lemon's gonna work yeah I think so oh yeah it's gonna work if it's hard to poke in smell see right now it is not on you guys three two four what do you think it's gonna do work or not definitely work so I guess you don't really need a lot of power so so far everything works so far which one you want to try next these three are very interesting yeah I'm gonna try this one the strawberry the swab Larry you barely have to poke this in to poke it in I want to see if we can do the same thing we did with the lemon oh good idea look we're gonna wow very cool which one do you want to do on your brains or watermelon the watermelon okay because grapes it's so small I know is it gonna work because it's so tiny do you think watermelon is gonna work let's see okay it's so easy to pop in [Music] um is it working [Music] what guys I didn't even need to complete the circuit it just powers on with two wow I didn't know watermelon is so powerful but this makes it a lot more powerful so it does work yay let's try the last one in the most wait how is this gonna work I don't know it's so small how we're gonna make it Opposite and positive I just have to stick them very gently can you do it yeah I did one no I did the other one [Music] so far is not working let's see what grapes can power on a clock look at that you guys just two grapes that's it that's all we need don't need a whole potato you just need two grapes well what if you just try one of them yeah with all of them it's working yeah all you need is one fruit it does work look just work too we don't even need to complete the circuit it's so powerful this is the most powerful yeah I think all you need is one Ryan I'm like this so Ryan's trying out different ones so one tomato and one lemon it works hey guys I'm gonna take my alarm clock to bed let's go I'm gonna go to bed now and that's how you make a fruit and vegetable alarm clock hi guys today we're doing a science experiment with Skittles we're gonna see if skills color dissolves in water and I think it does whoa [Music] now we're gonna spread the Skittles around like a circle on the plate I'm spraying all the different colors around like this all done look you can do it however you like because I made it like this and like this these are all the colors together next let's pour water onto the plate so Ryan's using warm water so don't forget to ask a parent for help now we're gonna see what happens it's already happening whoa look what's happening it's so cool so the more they are together the more bigger they are so what you notice is that the color is beating in the middle right yeah they are dissolving that looks cool [Music] whoa that is so cool oh and what did you notice it's a color mixed together no look it's separated right yeah the colors did not mix only me in the middle now let's try the other one and see what it looks like I think it's gonna those colors are gonna be really really big three two one [Music] that's enough oh it's happening oh um you know there's like a little toy thingy where it says What's this called press this card and you have to follow it it kind of looks like that oh yeah it does oh three two [Music] one that looks like a pizza that's bad it looks so cool guys it does and look since we did different patterns they look differently the question was did the skittle colors dissolve in water good yeah the food coloring on the Skittles and the sugar both dissolving water that's why we get it's really cool colors like those hmm if skills is all in water do M M's dissolve in water find out [Music] now let's spread them out on the plate [Music] like this and we make some of them big no I have two of them again I have one with a lot of colors and I have one that's random let's try so we're also using warm water so we're gonna try one with warm water and one with let's see it makes a difference or water right here [Music] starting yeah it is whoa so this is the m M's do you guys see any difference between the M M's and the Skittles yeah the M M's like twist it looks so cool do you feel like it's the same speed or you feel like it's different speed it's just like speed so you think it was going slower than the Skittles or faster than the Skittles I think faster than the Skittles oh three two one [Applause] [Music] bye bye there you go guys M M's which one do you like better the M M's or the skittle one so we've been letting these sit out for a while so it looks super different everything is coming together there and here you guys look it's all the little m m pieces on the back it's all white now so instead of the color they're all white do you see because all the colors are coming out we got regular water for the sink and now we're gonna add ice to it to make it I told oh we're gonna let it wait for like one minute that's right Ryan to make the water cold yeah okay I think it's ice cold now oh three oh [Music] while we wait do you guys think it's going to dissolve good question Ryan what do you think do you think the cold water or the hot water does that will help it dissolve faster I think the hot water will do a little faster okay let's check it out and see so we're gonna wait it's working oh he's moving it wait and see what happens so there's the cold water as you notice I think it's going a lot slower yeah we're waiting for a while now it's still working yeah they're just not going as fast [Music] what happens if you like blow it my question why don't you do it oh it doesn't change it just change the water [Music] oh water wow it's mixing it all together whoa it's creating like a Galaxy color [Music] wow that looks cool [Music] oh the other one looks cool when you mix you can try to blow that one too [Music] it's it's like a tornado when I blow it I know laughs [Music] [Music] oh this is turning orange yeah this is the m M's here so it's because it's chocolate with the color dissolved you see the chocolate left over right yeah and it turns brown hi guys today we're making homemade lava lamps like this okay so I have to wait a little bit and look what's gonna happen look that's cool you like it yeah [Music] yeah so here's what you need bottles food coloring Alka-Seltzer oil and optional if you want it glitter yeah so this one we have glitter inside but you don't need glitter First Step always ask a grown up for help hey what you need help on I need help with biggie this lava lamp okay here we go so we got oil I need three four oil on each container all right right on Ryan so put the funnel like this so you won't spill the oil all over yeah you're going in yeah [Music] oh let's build it up let's go let's go you see it coming down yeah one down and three to go all right let's keep going it's done now fill the rest with water you do that and I told you winter stuff oh never mind I'll do it I always ask for adults for help I'll play on the stock okay yeah perfect Perfecto next we're gonna keep doing it okay just take a closer look and just tell me when to stop counting on you cannot overfill either perfect we're in a dime here if you look here there's two layers there's water on the bottom and there's oil so yeah oil and water doesn't mix right yeah why why yeah why is it water and oil not don't mix can I hate each other while they're in just some oils just always getting tight is that live no because the water is more density oh good job Ryan because they have different density yeah water is more dense and oil and now we're gonna put food coloring first one is green okay maybe 10 drops being enough oh you see how it goes all the way down oh look going down yeah let's shake it up a little bit just make sure you drop all the food coloring to the bottom that I don't know foreign drops oh that one's just staying there is it gonna go up wait go ahead guys good job they kind of look almost the same yeah oh yeah pink and orange look same the last one is purple this one works hopefully pretty good there you go all right good job you're gonna get that down Ryan mix it up please okay whoa cool [Music] I don't want to go down whoa whoa look at that nice perfect Next Step Alka-Seltzer okay so the piece is a little big so we gotta break it up that's easy get it oh good job Ryan all right let's do it together three two one go [Music] okay that's cool close the cap yeah yeah not that way oh it's going crazy look at yours do I like yours Ryan oh there you go this one looks good actually let's see do you mind I like the orange one too it looks so cool it looks like actual lava yeah I like it so when it comes out it looks pink wow I like the orange one because it's actually lava yeah it does look like a lava nice there it is super easy and simple homemade experiment hi guys today we're gonna learn about how plants absorb water these are celery sticks yeah so plants needs water to grow right well we're gonna see what happens if we put different color in each cup First Step grab some water [Music] next let's pour the same amount of water in each cup after you fill up the water let's put food coloring in first I'm gonna do yellow and you can use any color you like [Music] agitate agitate don't forget to agitate oh looks like a tornado [Music] it does now it's [Music] great more oh that looks cool [Music] and now we're gonna do pink [Music] there you go [Music] oh [Music] we're gonna add just a few more drops [Music] okay whoa there's a lot of pink whoa okay now I'm gonna do blue [Music] oh everything agitate don't forget to add okay what does agitate mean to mix to mix or to stir yeah good job okay I'm gonna hit it [Music] thank you a little bit more purple maybe yeah maybe I think it's good yeah good job next step you put the salary into the glass before you put it in make sure you ask a grown-up to cut a little bit at the bottom there you go this one's big oh [Music] can we put multiple of each one yeah like that one doesn't have much maybe you can put another one in there there you go oh cool it was right here there it is so Ryan what do you think will happen when the celery absorbs the water what's your hypothesis what do you think I think the salary is gonna like turn into that color oh really so the water's gonna like go away oh so do you think it's gonna absorb the water and then the salad turns color so the glass is gonna go like to this much and the celery will change color oh so then if the salary is in a blue water what color would it be blue blue okay we're gonna see if Ryan hypothesis come true so we will be back tomorrow hi guys so it's been a day and here's the results so what's happening Ryan shoulder turning a low but other color you see yeah so you see the orange and the leaves are turning orange and then here's the blue one and some of the leaves so I don't think these are going as fast because this one only has one yes these have multiples oh you think that's why maybe and this is greens and some of the leaves are turning green yeah and then purple it's getting there some purple and then yellow yes yellow if you pick it up here not only on the leaves but also on the stem so you see orange there so you guys notice here that the water from the cup has to travel upwards to spread all around the plants now we're gonna leave it here for one more day and we're gonna see what it looks like bye see you tomorrow which is actually in like five seconds this is what happens on day two this orange one is really good it looks like fall in the bottom do you see how it's also orange yeah it looks pink kind of and then this blue one looks pretty good and this green one green as usual and purple whoa this looks cool yellow oh the leaves did turn yellow huh oh yeah yeah so it's really cool to learn about how plants are able to move the water from the bottom all the way up right Against Gravity you know that's called Ryan that's called No Gravity no gravity that's called capillary action capillary action popular reaction that's right hey guys today we're gonna learn and play with magnet all right Ryan first I wanted to see how many paper clips you can pick up okay oh oh I got a lot oh [Music] oh that's pretty cool you can see all the paper clips magnet whoa looks crazy huh yeah okay we're gonna do it together you ready one two three oh oh hooray it's sticking to each other it's magnetized see if you can pick up more I can pick up more yeah oh look at Mommy here oh we got a lot yeah so a magnet always have like a positive side and a negative side so I want you to try to put these two magnets together okay three two one so that's easy right okay now I want you to take one magnet and flip it to the other side now try to put it together oh this is impossible they really tell each other yeah there's like an invisible like wall here I did the before yeah invisible force can you put it together yeah no right no matter how hard Ryan tries it's not gonna work next I'm gonna do the penny stocking challenge look hey stack it up whoa wait I should do another big one oh [Music] so do it like this and then this and then this there you go higher oh oh oh how high can you stack it's hard it is hard huh okay while you do that I'm gonna try a chair how did they do this look we got three so far your mind's still working on his Kitty so hard I know sure it might keep falling yeah maybe we're doing on the opposite side why would be huh got it look at this beautiful [Music] oh there you go it's looking good [Music] nice [Music] oh oh These are too small yeah don't use those coins all right oi oi oh okay maybe uh this [Music] next we're gonna stack the blocks here I want to show you guys this really cool trick okay so I'll stack this side okay just literally stack it up okay okay like that there you go wait maybe I know what you're doing I don't know 100 like that there you go okay I have a ruler here where I put a magnet stuck into it okay and I'm gonna put this on top here hold this is gonna be like this there you go you can put it on top okay okay and obviously since the magnet is stuck right there you know that a paper clip you can just go to it right huh like so see the paper clip yeah then I have a string connected to a paper clip here do you see the paper clip okay I'm gonna Stick it to the bottom okay okay let it go okay let go of your hand huh oh did you see that what happened [Music] what's that face do you guys see what happened here what like what happens guys look like it's floating okay through maybe yeah yeah because it wants to be attached to the magnet do you see that that looks really cool huh oh yeah okay guys so be right back we're gonna make two more okay okay all right I'm gonna stick this magnet here okay I'm gonna stick this magnet here there we go so we had attached two more paper clip let's see if Ryan can do it okay oh and another one whoa you guys see how cool it is it's actually not touching it looks like it's floating in the air yeah whoa [Music] there it is a really cool magic trick yeah okay guys thank you for watching my fun magnet video see you next time bye remember always stay happy and rise up bye"

        "transcription": "This is Earth, a rocky planet, covered with¬†\nliquid water, orbiting within the habitable¬†¬† zone of a very typical star. From afar it may¬†\nnot look like much, but if you get close enough,¬†¬† it becomes quite clear that there is a lot to¬†\nstudy on this little blue world. Some choose to¬†¬† study botany, to learn about the wide variety¬†\nof plant life. Some study zoology and learn¬†¬† about all the animals walking on the land,¬†\nflying in the air, and swimming in the ocean.¬†¬† But some choose to study the Earth itself.\nWhat is the precise composition of the Earth?¬†¬† What is its history? The people who answer¬†\nthese questions are geologists. Now when¬†¬† most people think of a geologist, they tend¬†\nto imagine someone examining a bunch of rocks,¬†¬† and of course, geologists do indeed study rocks;¬†\nbut geology is also much more than this. To¬†¬† understand why earthquakes occur or how volcanoes¬†\nform, one must do more than simply look at rocks.¬†¬† At its core, geology is a multidisciplinary¬†\nscience that combines chemistry, physics,¬†¬† and mathematics to investigate an enormous variety¬†\nof processes that occur on and in the Earth.¬†¬† As we will come to understand in this series,¬†\ngeology encompasses every aspect of Earth‚Äôs¬†¬† structure, from the molten iron core to the¬†\nbeautiful minerals we find on its surface.¬†¬† Much of what geologists study transpired over¬†\nincredibly long timescales, originating anywhere¬†¬† from thousands to billions of years in the past.\nGeologic processes have shaped the entirety of¬†¬† Earth‚Äôs surface. For example, the Appalachian¬†\nMountains of Eastern North America contain¬†¬† limestones, which are composed of the shells of¬†\nmarine animals that lived there, in a shallow¬†¬† ocean more than 400 million years ago. Then, 300¬†\nmillion years ago, those rock beds were thrust¬†¬† upwards as Earth‚Äôs tectonic plates began to¬†\nconverge along the eastern US coast. Later, during¬†¬† glacial periods between 2 million and 12,000 years¬†\nago, mile-thick ice sheets scraped off the tops¬†¬† of these mountains, like huge bulldozers,¬†\nas they moved southward, then deposited¬†¬† hundreds of feet of sand and gravel in stream¬†\nvalleys as they retreated northward and melted.¬† How is it that we can know these things, exactly?¬†\nAnd furthermore, why even bother studying geology¬†¬† if all these phenomena occur on a much longer¬†\ntime scale than humans can observe during their¬†¬† lifetimes? The simple answer is that the processes¬†\nthat shaped our planet billions of years ago,¬†¬† still occur today and can be easily observed and¬†\nmeasured. Next time you visit the beach, pay close¬†¬† attention to the patterns of the sand, and observe¬†\nthem as they form from wind and water currents.¬†¬† These patterns are exactly what we¬†\nfind in many ancient sandstones,¬†¬† therefore it is reasonable to assume¬†\nthey were created by the same processes,¬†¬† just at different points in time. This is the¬†\nessence of geology. Observing beach sand form¬†¬† ripples and dunes may not be the most exciting¬†\nactivity to most, so you might be wondering,¬†¬† who would be interested in geology? The first¬†\nrecorded dabbling in geology was by Aristotle and¬†¬† the ancient Greeks. These ancient philosophers¬†\nwanted to understand natural phenomena,¬†¬† especially those impactful to human life,¬†\nlike earthquakes, volcanoes, and tidal waves.¬†¬† Aristotle thought earthquakes were caused by¬†\nopposing winds within the cavernous Earth, while¬†¬† Democritus thought the cause was water forcing¬†\nits way into the Earth as it rains. Obviously,¬†¬† these are both incorrect, and we now know¬†\nearthquakes to be caused by rocks cracking under¬†¬† the enormous stress created by plate tectonics,¬†\nbut the desire to understand is ancient.¬† Geology has come a long way since the time¬†\nof Aristotle and has many applications toward¬†¬† improving and protecting human life. For example,¬†\nvolcanologists, or geologists who study volcanoes,¬†¬† closely monitor active ones, and create early¬†\nwarning systems to evacuate towns before any¬†¬† volcanic eruptions. Furthermore, Earth contains¬†\nminerals, metals, and sources of energy that we¬†¬† have used to build and power the technology¬†\nand infrastructure responsible for raising¬†¬† our collective standard of living over the past¬†\nfew hundred years. In fact, many geologists work¬†¬† in the resource industry, finding new places¬†\nor developing new ways to extract minerals and¬†¬† energy. Others assess hazards to human life,¬†\nlike the volcanic eruptions we mentioned,¬†¬† but also slope failures, massive floods, and¬†\nstructural damage from earthquakes. Biologists¬†¬† interested in the evolution of life on Earth work¬†\nclosely with geologists in looking at the rock¬†¬† record to find the fossils and footprints¬†\nof organisms that are now long extinct.¬†¬† Climate scientists interested in understanding¬†\nour impact on the environment measure, among¬†¬† other things, greenhouse gases trapped inside¬†\ntiny bubbles from 800,000-year-old ice cores.¬†¬† The impact doesn‚Äôt even stop at our own planet.¬†\nThe understanding of Earth provided by geologists¬†¬† acts as the framework that planetary scientists¬†\nuse to study outflow channels on Mars, crater¬†¬† topography on the Moon, and unique features of¬†\nexoplanets that are continually being discovered.¬† So, as you can see, geology is not just about¬†\nlooking at rocks. It is as rich and multi-faceted¬†¬† as any other scientific discipline. As we¬†\nmentioned, geology utilizes concepts in chemistry,¬†¬† physics, and mathematics, and an understanding of¬†\nbasic concepts from these fields will be assumed¬†¬† as we move through this geology series. When we¬†\ntalk about the structure of various minerals,¬†¬† we won‚Äôt be reviewing chemistry concepts¬†\nregarding atomic and molecular structure,¬†¬† and when we talk about large-scale geological¬†\nevents, we won‚Äôt be reviewing physics terminology¬†¬† regarding forces and energy, nor the basic¬†\nalgebra that is sometimes required to discuss¬†¬† these phenomena quantitatively. So, if you need¬†\nto brush up on any of these subjects, my playlists¬†¬† in general chemistry, classical physics, and¬†\nmathematics will be of great use. But otherwise,¬†¬† when we encounter a topic that assumes such¬†\nprior knowledge, I will always link to the¬†¬† relevant tutorial using cards that appear in the¬†\nupper right corner of the screen, in case you need¬†¬† a brief refresher. But whatever your current level¬†\nof knowledge, if you‚Äôre invigorated by the thought¬†¬† of learning all about this beautiful planet¬†\nwe all live on, let‚Äôs start learning geology."

        "transcription": "What you are looking at is Morro Rock, a¬†\nfascinating geologic monolith which rises 581 feet¬†¬† or 177 meters above the Pacific Ocean which heads¬†\ninto Morro Bay. This structure has long fascinated¬†¬† locals, being visited by humans for more than¬†\n10,000 years, and is sometimes referred to as¬†¬† the \"Gibraltar of the Pacific\". But, how did this¬†\nbeautiful feature form, what is it composed of,¬†¬† and what relation does it have to similar¬†\nnearby California rock formations. This video¬†¬† will answer all of these questions through¬†\nthe perspective and analysis of a geologist.¬† As we zoom in on Morro Rock which is located¬†\n104 miles west of the city of Bakersfield,¬†¬† you might note that this impressive monolith has¬†\nthe same colored rock throughout. In other words,¬†¬† it is entirely composed of a singular rock type,¬†\nwith that being dacite. This is the exact same¬†¬† rock type that the vast majority of Mount Saint¬†\nHelens is composed of, including its two post 1980¬†¬† lava domes. Dacite is a type of high silica but¬†\nlow alkali element content lava which while it¬†¬† can be associated with stratovolcanoes, it¬†\nmore often is associated with the formation¬†¬† of lava domes. And, indeed, the dacite of Morro¬†\nrock was associated with what was likely once a¬†¬† growing lava dome volcano. However, the dacite¬†\nyou see here is technically a hypabyssal rock¬†¬† also known as a subvolcanic rock, meaning it is¬†\ntechnically an intrusive igneous rock that cooled¬†¬† at shallow depths of less than 2 kilometers¬†\nor 1.2 miles. In the case of Morro Rock,¬†¬† the dacite lava present represents the less¬†\neroded remnants of the rising magma which¬†¬† once filled much of its magma conduit, rather¬†\nthan the actual peak of the original volcano.¬†¬† It just so happens that the softer surrounding¬†\nground and rock along with the original lava flow¬†¬† which was more susceptible to erosion eroded¬†\nway millions of years ago, causing the harder¬†¬† intrusive igneous rock which was more resistant¬†\nto erosion to become exposed on the surface,¬†¬† hence its modern appearance. In other words, Morro¬†\nrock represents what is known as a volcanic plug.¬†¬† Hypothetically speaking, if I was to cut away¬†\nthe top 3000 feet of this lava dome emplaced in¬†¬† 1350 near Mono Lake and let some erosion occur, it¬†\nmight eventually create a similar looking feature.¬† Looking around, you might note that there¬†\nare other nearly identical features nearby.¬†¬† 2 miles to the east-southeast, you have¬†\nBlack Hill that is also made of dacite,¬†¬† representing yet another volcanic plug of¬†\na similar age. Yet, this chain of similar¬†¬† looking features continues onwards, encompassing¬†\nat least 13 total volcanic plugs with some sources¬†¬† claiming the actual figure is 23 that extend¬†\nalong a lineament for 17 miles. Altogether,¬†¬† these volcanic plugs are known as the 9¬†\nSisters, even though there are more than 9,¬†¬† just don't ash why. Each of these plugs¬†\nwithin the Nine Sisters formed between¬†¬† 26 and 20 million years associated with viscous¬†\nmagma intrusions that fed a likely monogenetic¬†¬† chain of volcanic vents along an ancient fault¬†\nline. However, this raises another question. Why¬†¬† would a cluster of volcanoes just suddenly form¬†\nhere in relative isolation around 25 million¬†¬† years ago? While we still aren't 100% sure, here¬†\nis one possibility that I deem to be plausible.¬† 30 million years ago, the large Farallon Tectonic¬†\nPlate offshore of California was subducting¬†¬† underneath the North American Plate. However,¬†\nat the same time, as this plate moved eastwards,¬†¬† a section of a spreading mid ocean ridge began to¬†\nbe subducted. Since this mid ocean ridge contained¬†¬† crust which was very thin, it allowed for molten¬†\nrock in the mantle to rise through it and then¬†¬† intrude into the overlying tectonic plate. While¬†\nsome of this magma erupted onto the surface,¬†¬† other portions did not and remained at shallow¬†\ndepths, cooling to form a series of dacite to¬†¬† rhyolite monoliths. These volcanic plugs which¬†\nwere once oriented south to north were later¬†¬† rotated due to the motion of the San Andreas¬†\nFault and nearby terranes counterclockwise by¬†¬† 45 degrees to form their modern appearance. Are¬†\nthey any other local geologic formations that¬†¬† you want me to discuss? Be sure to let me know¬†\nin the comments section below. As a final note,¬†¬† I would like to thank my new YouTube channel¬†\nmember Joshua Friedman for supporting my work!"

        "transcription": "NARRATOR: Planet Earth is\nunique, an immense ball of rock 25,000 miles around. It is a refuge. 1/3 land, 2/3 water, and with\nan atmosphere rich in oxygen, it is the only known home in the\nuniverse for living creatures. But this blue-green oasis has\nnot always been so welcoming. The planet bears the\nscars of a traumatic past, a past of extreme environments,\nand extreme catastrophes. Over the course of nearly\nfive billion years, it has been a changing world, a\nworld of fire, a world of ice. One of raging seas\nand poisonous skies. The life forms that now\ncling to its surface are the lucky survivors of\na succession of deadly mass extinctions. For just over 200 years,\ndetermined scientists have explored the planet\nand unearthed its secrets. Their remarkable\ndiscoveries have led them to tell an incredible\nstory, the story of \"How the Earth was Made.\" [music playing] For thousands of years,\nhumans had no knowledge of the true age and\norigin of the world, but just over 200 years\nago, all this would change. Scotland, the Edinburgh coast. It was here one day in\n1788 that the discovery of a small, rocky outcrop would\ncompletely rewrite the history of the Earth. [music playing] Geologist Geoffrey Boulton is on\nhis way to the desolate Siccar Point where this discovery\nwas made by a maverick Scottish farmer, James Hutton. Hutton was to become the\nfather of modern geology. Hutton was a man who was\nenthusiastic in the pursuit of truth, a very enquiring mind. When he took over\nhis father's farm, he saw underneath\nthe soils rocks and wondered what these were. NARRATOR: Hutton spent years\nobsessed with understanding how the rocks of the\nEarth were made. His intrepid field expeditions\ntook him all over Scotland, and they led him to realize that\nextremely slow processes could create the rocks he saw\nfrom layers of sediment. GEOFFREY BOULTON: He rode\nmiles and miles on his horse to go to places where\nhe thought he could find exciting geological experiences,\neven though he suffered terribly from saddle sores. NARRATOR: Hutton concluded\nthat rocks could take hundreds of thousands of years to\nform, but his claims were speculative, and\nhis radical ideas flew in the face of the accepted\nversion of Earth history provided by the church. For generations,\nthe Christian church had been the sole\nauthority on all creation, based on the Book of Genesis. And using the biblical\ngenealogies, church leaders were now confidently\nclaiming they knew the exact age\nof the Earth itself. Archbishop Ussher\nin the 17th century had calculated that the\nEarth was 6,000 years old, and indeed, he calculated that\nit was made on October the 14th in the afternoon. NARRATOR: Hutton was convinced\nthat the Earth had to be much older, and when his explorations\nled him to a Siccar Point in 1788, he would\nfinally find the proof he was looking for in\nthe unusual formation he discovered. [music playing] GEOFFREY BOULTON: These rocks\nare not just any old rocks, they're very special rocks. And the reason they're special\nis because of the story Hutton was able\nto tell from them. NARRATOR: Here, two\nlayered rock formations stand at right\nangles to each other. He knew these rocks had once\nbeen laid down horizontally on the seafloor. They must then have been\nburied under great depth to re-crystallize. They must then have been tilted\non end by great Earth forces, then they were eroded\naway and truncated, and these rocks were\ndeposited on top. And he realized that that would\nnot take hundreds of years, nor thousands of years,\nbut many millions of years. NARRATOR: Hutton's discovery\nwas a turning point. From that day forward, it\nwas rock, not scripture, that would become the trusted\nguide to the distant past. And over the next two\ncenturies, the study of rocks around the globe would\nlead to the awesome revelation that this blue-green planet\nhas been on the most astounding journey, a journey that\nbegan in a world of fire. [music playing] It is now believed that\nthe Earth was formed from collisions among the\ncountless meteors that made up the early solar system. [meteor exploding] Back then, the surface was\nan ocean of molten rock, miles deep. Temperatures exceeded 8,000\ndegrees Fahrenheit, similar to the surface of the Sun. And huge meteorites rained down\nin a relentless bombardment. [music playing, explosions] The man who first proposed this\nhellish origin for the planet was the Victorian\nscientist Lord Kelvin. A British expert in\nthermodynamics, Kelvin believed that the Earth\nwas slowly cooling down. The fires of the\nplanet's interior, visible in volcanic\neruptions, suggested to him that the planet had once\nbeen completely molten. Kelvin used thermodynamics\nto calculate a new age for the Earth. He reasoned that the molten\nplanet would need nearly 20 million years to cool to\nits present temperatures. Kelvin was correct about\nthe Earth being molten, but not about its age. His figure was a\ncolossal underestimate. Like all 19th\ncentury scientists, Kelvin was unaware of\na key source of heat inside the early Earth\nthat prevented the planet from cooling as he predicted. Radioactivity. In the early Earth, radioactive\nparticles of uranium, thorium, and potassium were\nin huge abundance. The heat produced from the\ndecay of these particles would keep the Earth extremely\nhot for an extremely long time. But although these\nparticles confounded Kelvin's calculations, they\nwould eventually prove the keys to unlocking the true\nage of the Earth. In the 20th century,\nrare particles of surviving radioactive\nuranium were collected together to create the first\natomic weapons, but scientists had earlier\nfound a different application, using the radioactive particles\nto accurately date the planet. In 1911, a gifted 21-year-old\ngeology student, Arthur Holmes, used radiation to revolutionize\nour understanding of Earth history. After Holmes, geologists would\ntalk in billions, not millions of years. Radiometric dating was\nsimple in principle. It was based on the\ndiscovery that traces of the radioactive\nelement, uranium, found throughout the\nrocks of the Earth, decayed into another\nelement, lead. Like sand, trickling through\nan hourglass over hundreds of millions of years,\nand at a steady rate, a sample of radioactive\nuranium will decay to lead. By measuring the\nproportion of uranium to lead in crystals\ntrapped in ancient rocks, Holmes could accurately\ncalculate their ages. Collecting data from samples\nfrom all over the world would be a lifetime's worth. But as Holmes grew\nolder, so did the Earth. Its calculated age extended\nfirst to one, then three, then finally, to 4.5 billion years. Today, 4.5 billion\nyears is still the accepted age for the Earth. Time on this incredible\nscale is known to those in the business as deep time. GEOFFREY BOULTON: It's\ndifficult to imagine how vast deep time is. Think of it this way,\nthat's a grain of sand. If it represented a year,\nthen the length of my finger would be equivalent to\nthe whole of my lifetime. The tip of my finger to my\nelbow would take us back to the pilgrim fathers. From here to the\nrocky island you see on the horizon\nwould take us back to the age of the dinosaurs. And if we were to turn\naround and go to the equator, then it would be\nequivalent to going back to the beginning of the Earth,\n4 and 1/2 billion years ago. NARRATOR: The search for the\nage of the Earth was over, and the results had opened\na window on the past. For the first time,\nscientists could put rocks in the correct order, look\ndeep into the Earth's past, and tell its story. They would discover\nevidence of an epic journey with many twists and turns. But the most significant\nstep may well have been taken within just a\nfew million years of its birth, when the planet\nbecame a water world. [music playing] 4.5 billion years ago, the Earth\nwas formed from the collisions of millions of meteors in\nthe young solar system. Temperatures were so high\nthat the planet's surface was a molten ocean. But even at that time,\nEarth was beginning to cool. The radioactivity that\nprovided much of the heat was slowly declining, paving\nthe way for the planet's first radical change,\nits transformation into a water world. [music playing] The Barberton\nHills, South Africa. This remote region\nis home to some of the oldest rocks on Earth. South African\ngeologist Gary Stevens is on the lookout for some of\nthese incredibly rare survivors from the first billion\nyears of Earth history, whose unique shape\ntells a story. GARY STEVENS: This area of\nSouth African geology here on the eastern\nside of Mpumalanga is critical for our\nunderstanding of early Earth processes. NARRATOR: Gradual erosion\nalong the trickling creek can occasionally expose\nthese primordial rocks. Here, we have an\ninteresting rock. The rounded shape of\nthis rock over here is very different than the\nrounded shape of the rest of the rocks in this river. This is one of these 3.5\nbillion year old pillow lavas. The rounded pillow\nshape in the rock is the result of the lava that\nformed under water in an ocean approximately 3 and\n1/2 billion years ago. NARRATOR: Pillow lavas\nare created today off the coast of Hawaii,\nwhere volcanic vents erupt into the Pacific Ocean. This unique pillow shape is\nonly formed when lava solidifies under deep water. All rocks found from the\nperiod 3.5 billion years ago have been pillow lavas. By one billion years into\nthe planet's existence, water had taken\nover, but geologists believe that it had already\nbeen around a long, long time. [music playing] 4.4 billion years ago. The Earth was around\n100 million years old. Meteors still crashed\ninto the planet, but gradual cooling of the core\nhad allowed most of the surface to solidify into a crust\nof dark volcanic rock. And even then, at\nthis early stage, water was forming\non the surface. No rocks now survive from\nthis most early period, but tiny crystals of zircon do. Uranium-carrying zircon\nis one of the crystals that help date the\nEarth, but these crystals can also retain the\nchemical fingerprints of water molecules. And these fingerprints are all\nover the most ancient zircons. But the origin of the\nmajority of the planet's water remains a mystery. As the planet cooled,\nthe surface rocks began spewing out tons\nof carbon dioxide. Some water vapor would have\nbeen vented during this process, but some believe it\nwould not have been enough to cover the surface. DAN DURDA: Rocks,\nthe material that accreted to form the Earth\nitself would have been too dry, too-- too close\nto the early hot Sun. We have this problem\nof trying to understand where-- where our water\nworld got all of its water. NARRATOR: Impact expert Dan\nDurda supports the theory that the source of most\nof the Earth's water was extraterrestrial. DAN DURDA: The idea today is\nthat the Earth's oceans arrived from above. They were brought in in the\nwater-rich asteroids and comets which peppered the\nEarth during the tail off in its accretionary process. What I have here is a piece\nof an actual meteorite. This is the material from\nwhich the Earth itself formed. This primitive little meteorite\ncontains about 5% water. It's that water in\nobjects like this that was delivered to the Earth\nto form the Earth's oceans. NARRATOR: Scientists\nare divided on this, but wherever the water came\nfrom, when it did arrive, it changed the\nplanet dramatically. As it evaporated\noff the surface, huge amounts of water vapor\nrose to join the carbon dioxide in the young atmosphere, forming\nthick, blanketing clouds. [music playing] This condensing water would\ntrigger the greatest downpour the Earth would ever see. [thunder crashing] As thunderstorms\nrocked the skies, the rain began to fall on\nthe rocky surface below. And it kept on falling. It would rain for millions and\nmillions and millions of years. The result would\nbe a water world. Four billion years ago. The Earth was now half\na billion years old. Over 90% of its surface\nhad become a vast ocean. Small volcanic islands\npoked out from the waves. The monstrous seas where\niron-rich, making them an olive green color. Carbon dioxide filled the sky so\nthickly that they appeared red. The dense atmosphere\nproduced enough pressure to crush a human body flat. And it was hot. Temperatures exceeded\n200 degrees Fahrenheit. This toxic, hostile\nwater world would remain for another half billion years. But dramatic transformations\nwere on their way. Renewed volcanic activity\nwould trigger the construction of the continents by creating\na totally new kind of rock. Earth was about to\nbecome a granite planet. 3.4 billion years ago. The Earth was just over\na billion years old. Huge, green oceans dominated. [music playing] None of the crumbling volcanic\nislands dotting the surface survived the punishing\nsea for long, but everything was\nabout to change. An upsurge in undersea\nvolcanic activity was about to create a\ntougher type of rock and give birth to\nthe continents. In remote areas of the\nglobe, the primeval cores of these first continents\nhave been exposed. South Africa. Geologist Gary Stevens is\nclimbing on some of the oldest continental rock on Earth. These rocks are special. We're standing here\non ancient granite. This granite forms the nucleus\nof one of the world's oldest continents, and we can see\nit here in the Barberton area in South Africa. NARRATOR: These eroded\noutcrops of rock are the visible peaks of what\nis known as the Kaapvaal Craton, a titanic mass of ancient\ngranite underlying southern Africa, a remnant\nof the early Earth. 3.5 billion years ago, granite\nwas appearing everywhere. An upsurge of volcanism\nhad fractured the crust of the Earth underneath\nthe vast oceans, allowing water to plunge into\nthe cracks alongside the molten lavas. The mixture of superheated\nwater and basaltic lava produced the new rock, granite. It rose from the depths to\nform the first true continental crust. This is why granite is\nspecial and important. It's light. This rock, granitic rock,\nhas a much lower density than this rock, a basaltic rock. The difference in density\nbetween these two rocks is greater than the difference\nin density between water and air. This rock would be typical\nfor oceanic crustal material. This is typical\nof the continents. Continents are\nlight and buoyant. Oceanic crust,\ndenser and heavier. It literally floats\non the mantle. NARRATOR: Granite crust was\nnot only light, it was tough, tough enough to withstand the\nerosion of power of the oceans. [music playing] For the next couple\nof billion years, slowly, but surely, the\ngranitoid protocontinents grew larger. On different parts of\nthe globe, granite crust appeared that would\none day form the hearts of the major landmasses. The dominance of\nthe oceans was over. The continents had arrived. The slow expansion of the\ngranite protocontinents was to change more than just\nthe appearance of the planet. The shallow coastlines\nwould bring life to the sunlit surface, and\nhelp trigger the production of oxygen. Almost since the\narrival of the first oceans, it is believed that primitive,\nsingle-celled life forms had appeared, deep\nbeneath the waves, living off the heat produced by\nthe subsea volcanic fissures. But now, they were evolving\nand spreading upwards. On the continental\ncoasts, an organism was appearing that was\nto transform the planet, the stromatolite. The stromatolite would\nlive off sunlight, and it would fill the\natmosphere with oxygen. This primeval organism\ncan still be found today. [music playing] Western Australia. Martin Van Kranendonk is over\n100 miles from the nearest town heading across the\noutback to a remote beach. We're going down this track to\none of the most unique places in the world where you've\ngot living stromatolites on the shoreline\nhere at Shark Bay. On the narrow sandy\ncoast of Shark Bay, a multitude of stromatolites\nfill the tidal shallows. Each of these\nunusual rocky mounds are up to 1 foot\nacross and 2 feet high. It was only in the 1950s that\nthe importance of Shark Bay was realized. Following trips to\nthis remote site, Australian geologist\nPhillip Playford was the first to discover\nhow stromatolites formed. Playford identified a\nrare bacterial algae found in a slimy film coating\ntheir surface as the creator of the mounds themselves. MARTIN VAN KRANENDONK:\nStromatolites are made up of very thin layers\nof microorganisms that build up slowly, layer\nby layer, year by year, as they use light energy\nto gain their food, and as their waste product,\nthey precipitate rock. NARRATOR: Other geologist\nrecognized the significance of Playford's findings. Patterns they had seen in\nrocks billions of years old were, in fact,\nfossilized stromatolites. Playford's discovery had\nsparked off a fossil revolution. Once people knew that\nthese kind of structures were made by living\norganisms, they went back into the rock record\nand found that they found the same kinds of\nstructures, and therefore, could deduce that life\noccupied planet Earth 3 and 1/2 billion years ago. These are really the ancestors\nof everything on Earth. We're actually looking at our\ngreat, great, great, great, great, great, great,\ngreat, great grandmothers and grandfathers. [music playing] NARRATOR: The rock record shows\nthat by 2.5 billion years ago, stromatolites were\nblossoming globally. All beaches on Earth would\nhave resembled Shark Bay. [music playing] And as stromatolites\nfilled the shallows, they began to fill the\natmosphere with oxygen. Planet Earth and\nthe solar system is the only planet that\nhas an atmosphere composed of a large amount of\noxygen. Geoscientists think that that oxygen\ncame only from the reaction of stromatolites. NARRATOR: The algae turned\nsunlight into oxygen, a process known as photosynthesis. Over a period of\ntwo billion years, countless generations\nof stromatolites pumped out over 20 million,\nbillion tons of oxygen. At first, the gas dissolved into\nthe oceans, where it rusted out billions of tons of iron. But eventually, it would\nalso fill the atmosphere and transform the planet. The planet's very appearance\nwas dramatically altered. As the iron left the oceans,\nthey changed from green to blue. When the oxygen moved\non to the atmosphere, it diluted the remaining\nthick carbon dioxide and cleared the air. [music playing] After nearly two billion\nyears of oxygenation, the blue planet was born. The Earth now had its blue\noceans and its blue sky. Relics of this great\ntransformative period survive today in immense\nlayers of iron-rich sediment originally deposited on the\nfloors of the ancient oceans. Scattered all\nthroughout the globe, the banded iron formations,\nas they are known, are vital for today's economies. They are the major source\nof all the iron mined today. Following its oxygenation, the\nEarth was more recognizable. But before it would\nbecome the planet we know, a new cycle of cataclysmic\nevents would take place. Over the next billion\nyears, deep movements would wrench apart the crust,\nand life, which had just begun to make its mark, would\nface its toughest test yet. [music playing] 1.5 billion years ago. Planet Earth was almost\nthree billion years old. For the first time\nin its history, it was beginning to\nresemble the planet we know. Newly arrived oxygen had\nturned the oceans blue, and the continents had grown\nto cover nearly a quarter of the surface. But their expansion\nwas not over. And beneath the oceans,\ndeep forces were at work, rearranging their positions. Imperceptibly, the\ncontinents were on the move. [music playing] Mark McMenamin is an expert\nin plate tectonics, the study of continental movement. Until the 1960s, this\nwas radical science. MARK MCMENAMIN: In the 19th\nand early 20th century, the consensus view was that\nthe continents were fixed. All geology was local, and the\ncontinents stay in one place. NARRATOR: But problems for\nthis view had been mounting. One of the greatest mysteries\nwas the geographic position of certain fossils. Trilobites, like\nthe one on my left here, belong to the\ngenus Paradoxides. NARRATOR: The Paradoxides\nreally was a paradox. It was a freshwater creature\nwith a curious distribution. MARK MCMENAMIN: This trilobite\nis found in the eastern part of North America. And also, in Britain, on\nthe other side of the Atlantic Ocean. NARRATOR: The freshwater\nparadoxides could not have swum the vast, salty ocean. And they were not\nthe only fossils showing bizarre\nintercontinental distribution. Geologists struggled\nfor an explanation. In 1912, a radical new theory\nwould emerge from Greenland that would lay the foundations\nfor plate tectonics and shake Earth science\nto its foundations. The new theory was put forward\nby a German weather scientist, Alfred visionary\nWegener, a man who had spent much of his career\nconducting atmospheric research in Greenland's frozen wastes. But Wegener had always been\nfascinated by the geologist's fossil paradox, and he boldly\nclaimed that the answer was staring them in the face. MARK MCMENAMIN: Ever since\naccurate world maps were available,\nschoolchildren and others have pointed out the fit between\nthe east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa,\nand this was always dismissed in reputable scientific\ncircles as just a coincidence of no meaning, and so\nmany disappointed children were turned away and told\nthat their idea was wrong. Wegener proposed that the\ncontinents had indeed once been joined together, and had\nsubsequently drifted apart. His observations in\nGreenland convinced him this continental\ndrift was possible. I think that his inspiration\nwas meteorological. Perhaps he saw a\nbreakup of ice floes, and made what we would call an\nextrapolation to the hard rock part of the planet. NARRATOR: But few\ngeologists could accept the radical theories\nof a mere meteorologist. MARK MCMENAMIN: There\nwas complete rejection of what Wegener was saying. This is a tall order, to\ntake a gigantic continent and shove it through\nthe ocean floor to get it halfway\nacross the globe. NARRATOR: Throughout his life,\nWegener fought to gain evidence for his theory, but his\nbrave attempts eventually led to his demise. In 1930, his last\nexpedition to Greenland ended in tragedy when he\nlost his way in a snowstorm. MARK MCMENAMIN: In a icy\nsituation on a glacier, it's difficult to find your way. Separated from both his base\ncamp and the other members of his expedition, he basically\ngot lost and died of exposure. NARRATOR: Wegener was dead, but\nhis theory of continental drift lived on. [explosions, weapons firing] The breakthrough came after the\nUS Navy produced a global map of the ocean floor,\noriginally commissioned for submarine warfare\nduring World War II. This detailed map revealed\none of the Earth's greatest secrets, the fractured\nnetwork of submarine mountain, volcanic rifts, and trenches\nthat split the oceans into enormous plates of crust. These plates would be\nthe building blocks for the new science\nof plate tectonics. The rifts and trenches\nwould provide a solution to how continents drift\nby proving that the ocean floors are continuously\nbeing recycled. MARK MCMENAMIN: Plate\ntectonics is completely driven by the\ndestruction of the old and the creation of the new. NARRATOR: Deep below the\nsurface, mobile mantle rock is in continuous circular motion\nfollowing convection currents of heat generated deep\nwithin the planet. Where these currents rise,\nthe rifts form, and the plates are pushed apart, with new\nocean crust created in the gap. Where the mantle currents\nsink back down into the Earth, they drag old oceanic plate down\nwith them towards the interior. If the ocean plate moves,\nso do the continents. MARK MCMENAMIN: That oceanic\nplate drags the continent along with it. The process is like an\nescalator or a conveyor belt. NARRATOR: The process\nof ocean creation is visible today on a\nrocky island in the middle of the Atlantic, Iceland. Iceland lies on the mid-Atlantic\nridge, a 10,000 mile long range of subsea volcanic mountains\nthat mark one of the deep rifts in the Earth's crust. Iceland is really like a\npeak of this mountain chain. It's like a huge volcano\nsitting on top of it. NARRATOR: Seismologist P ll\nEinarsson studies the volcanism of this remote island, volcanism\nthat is helping to expand the Atlantic Ocean. [music playing] Occasionally, an unusual type\nof volcanic eruption on Iceland confirms that plate tectonic\nprocess, a fissure eruption. A fissure eruption\nis a wall of fire. They could be 25 miles long,\nand spew lava hundreds of feet into the air. People fear eruptions. They respect the volcanoes. [music playing] NARRATOR: The fissures mark the\npath of the deep plate boundary that is creating the Atlantic. All across the island, running\nfrom northeast to southwest, are the remains of\nthese fissure eruptions, scarring the rocky landscape\nwith shallow canyons. These canyons are very\nslowly widening Iceland. [music playing] At their base, new crust is\nbeing created, pushing Europe and America apart. So here we are, located in\nthe fissure between the two continental plates,\nthe two crustal plates. Here, on my left, we have\nthe North America plate, and on the other\nside, we have Europe. This fissure here is\nin a lava flow that's only about 8,000 years old. So in 8,000 years, that's how\nmuch the two plates have moved. DAN DURDA: The rate of\ncontinental drift averages about 2.5 centimeters per year,\nthe rate at which fingernails typically grow. NARRATOR: 2.5 centimeters,\none inch per year, means that in one\nhuman lifetime, America and Europe will move\njust 6 feet further apart. But over millions of years,\nthis speed of movement was enough to shift the\ncontinents thousands of miles. [music playing] Using plate tectonics\nas their guide, geologists such\nas Mark McMenamin have reconstructed the epic\nstory of continental movement from the beginning. From samples taken from present\nday continental margins, they've compared fossils\nand microfossils, and matched up distinctive\ntypes of ancient rocks to reconstruct where the\ncontinents used to be. MARK MCMENAMIN:\nIt's a tricky task. It's kind of like Humpty Dumpty,\nyou've got all of these pieces. You need to use\nwhatever clues you can, whatever fingerprints you had\nto put one continental margin against the other. NARRATOR: They are now\nconfident that they can trace the movement of the continents\nback over a billion years to a time of a mass\ncontinental collision. [music playing] As the oceans between\nthem were swallowed up, the large land\nmasses drew together in what was to become a\nsupercontinent, Rodinia. It is believed that\nCanada and the USA formed the supercontinent's\nheart, with other continents bunched around them. But Rodinia was unlike\nany continent seen today. It was a desolate,\nlifeless place. MARK MCMENAMIN: It\nwould've been very much like being in the desert. It would've been similar to\nparts of the Sahara, Death Valley. There would have been no plants,\nno forests, no grasslands. Rodinia would've been\na barren continent. NARRATOR: Rodinia may\nhave been lifeless, but it was to have a profound\neffect on life in the oceans. In the oxygenated waters,\nprimitive life forms were blooming alongside\nthe stromatolites. But the huge supercontinent\nwas about to give them a tremendous shock. Rodinia was to\ntrigger what is now known as snowball Earth, the\nbiggest freeze the world has ever seen. By around 700 million years\nago, Rodinia's position was blocking the currents\nthat brought warm water from the equator to the poles. Without this heat, the\npolar regions froze. The resulting ice reflected\nmore of the Sun's rays away from the Earth, and in a\ncatastrophic snowballing effect, temperatures\ndropped still further, and the ice advanced\nto cover the Earth. [music playing] Surface temperatures fell\nbelow minus 40 degrees. The oceans were covered in an\nice sheet almost a mile deep. The only life on Earth,\nmarine bacterias and algae, were trapped beneath\nin the darkness. The result was disaster. All but a tiny\nfraction of organisms were driven to extinction. The whole planet was dying. [music playing] 650 million years ago. Climate changes triggered\nby the formation of the supercontinent\nRodinia had left the surface of the Earth covered with a\nsheet of ice 1 mile thick. Temperatures hovered below\nminus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Marine organisms, the\nonly life on the planet, had almost been wiped out. The future of life on\nEarth hung in the balance. [music playing] But beneath the ice, the\nsupercontinent was in turmoil. Vast volcanic eruptions were\nsplitting Rodinia apart. It's thought that the\naccumulation of heat at the base of a supercontinent\nis what eventually leads to its undoing. It's like putting a\nblanket over the Earth. The heat that's generated\nfrom the Earth's interior will accumulate\nunderneath that blanket. NARRATOR: The heat would\nspell the end of the snowball. As Rodinia ruptured,\ncarbon dioxide released by the eruptions\ncreated a temporary greenhouse effect. The ice sheets drew back. Rodinia had broken\ninto giant fragments. And the icy grip\non life was broken. As shallow seas opened\nup in Rodinia's wake, and oxygen levels increased,\nthe primitive organisms were free to take their\nnext great step forward. They would become complex,\nand a lot more dangerous. [music playing] The Canadian Rockies. These remote mountains\nare home to a rare record of this key event in\nthe evolution of life, the so-called\nCambrian explosion. PAUL MCNEIL: For the first\ntime in the history of life on Earth, we have some of\nthe highest oxygen levels that we've had since the\nEarth was actually formed. Life bloomed. We see animals unlike\nwe've ever seen before. NARRATOR: Paleontologist\nPaul McNeil is hiking up to a remote\nmountain quarry known as the Burgess Shale. The astonishing\nfossils in this quarry are a window on the\nworld as it existed over 500 million years ago. PAUL MCNEIL: If you\nsurveyed all the people who study the history of life, you\nget almost unanimous agreement that this is one of the\nmost important fossil sites in the world. [music playing] NARRATOR: The man who\ndiscovered the Burgess Shale was an American, Charles Doolittle\nWalcott, the president of The Smithsonian Institute. This fanatical fossil hunter,\nwho was born into poverty, had lived the American dream. Armed only with a\nhigh school diploma, he had fought his way to the\ntop of the American scientific establishment. But it was his tenacious\nfossil-hunting expeditions in the most remote mountains\nof North America that would lead to his most\nstunning achievement. This is the actual\nlocation where Walcott first made his amazing discovery. As the legend goes,\nit's August 31, 1909, riding along this very trail\nwith his wife in a snow storm, and as they're riding along, a\nlarge slab of rock came down, blocked the trail, and\nthey couldn't get by. , Now being a gentleman, as\nall paleontologists are, he immediately\nleapt off his horse, flipped over the slab of\nrock, and found an incredibly well-preserved fossil. If it was down on the trail,\nwhere did it come from? Nowhere but up there. NARRATOR: The source\nof the rockfall was a section of the cliff\nno more than 100 feet across, a small area that became\nthe celebrated Burgess Shale Quarry. [music playing] Walcott, often aided\nby his own family, eventually extracted\nover 60,000 fossils. And since Walcott,\na further 100,000 have been excavated from this\nuniquely rich cliff face. Quarrying the\nrocks of the mountain requires a tremendous\namount of work, a lot of backbreaking labor. But it's also\nextremely exciting, because every time\nyou split open a rock, you never know what\nyou're going to find. Most of the time, you find\nnothing, but every once in a while, you find a new\nanimal, one that's never been seen before, one that's been\nrevealed for the first time in half a billion years. NARRATOR: The thousands of\nfossils found in the Burgess Shale revealed that starting\n500 million years ago, life exploded with staggering\ndiversity and complexity. PAUL MCNEIL: The\npreservation of these fossils is actually incredible in that\nthey're actually preserved in three dimensions. You can excavate through\nthe fossils themselves, see the internal organs,\nremove the organs, see the digestive tract. There's this fantastic\npreservation. Oh, look, it's\nstarting to crack. And there goes a piece. What we have here is\nan actual Anomalocaris. These guys were up\nto a meter in length. That actually made them\nthe T-Rex of the Cambrian. [music playing] NARRATOR: In the Cambrian seas,\nthe oxygen-rich shallow waters were teeming with\ncomplex organisms. And creatures were feeding\nnot just on plants, but on each other. PAUL MCNEIL: Cambria's actually\none of most special times in the history of life. We see more different\ntypes of animals than we see in the rest of\nthe entire history of life on Earth. NARRATOR: From this time\nonwards, with a biological arms race driving their\nevolution, creatures would become\nincreasingly complex, with the development of hard\nshells, skeletons, eyes, and teeth. Modern animals had\narrived on Earth. [music playing] The high level of oxygen that\nhad triggered this explosion of life in the seas was also\nmaking a final modification to the atmosphere. Over the next 100 million\nyears, oxygen reached today's high levels, a\nlevel dense enough to allow an ozone layer to\nform in the upper atmosphere. This layer was to free\nlife forms from the oceans. Previously, powerful\nultraviolet light would destroy any organism\nnot protected by the water. Now, the ozone layer\nwould act as a UV shield. [music playing] 400 million years ago. The Earth is more than\nfour billion years old. Over the next 100 million years,\nthe continents would once again converge, and this time,\nthanks to the ozone shield, life was free to leave the\noceans and conquer the land. Planet Earth had become a\nworld of tropical swamps. [music playing] South Georgia, USA,\nthe Okefenokee Swamp. FRED RICH: The\nOkefenokee is believed to be what we would call\nan analog, a modern analog for an environment that's very\nsimilar to the wetlands that existed on Earth in the past. NARRATOR: Fred Rich is an expert\non prehistoric swamp land. Geologists like him believe that\nthis freshwater swamp closely mimics the surface\nof the continents 300 million years\nago, in a period known as the Carboniferous. FRED RICH: Carboniferous\nwas an unusual time, because it was the first\nperiod in Earth's history when large plants occupied\nEarth's surface, 40, 50, 70 feet high that\ngrew in dense groves and produced a\nvast forest canopy in a steamy, tropical jungle\natmosphere that was something entirely new on the\nface of the Earth. NARRATOR: This dense\ntropical swamp land would dominate the Earth for\nthe next 60 million years. The evidence is present on\nall of today's continents in the form of coal. The coal we use for fuel was\nformed from millions of years worth of accumulated plant\nmatter, most of which existed less than 300\nmillion years ago. [music playing] And it formed because\nof the unique way freshwater swamps decompose. PAUL MCNEIL:\nOkefenokee is derived from a Native American\nword that means land of the trembling earth. It's not very easy to\nwalk through the swamp, because the subsurface\nis soggy plant remains. NARRATOR: The fresh water\nprevents the vegetation from decaying, allowing huge\namounts to build up over time. Beneath me is not the\nregular sort of soil that you would have\nin your backyard. The soil that you see\nhere is the plant material that accumulated last year,\nor perhaps five years ago. It's leaves, stems,\ntwigs, there's still a good bit of water in this. But if we put this under\ntremendous amount of pressure and add some heat by covering\nover with layers of rock and leaving it in the ground\nfor millions of years, eventually, it will\nchange to this. This is a piece of\nbituminous coal, and it's on the order of\n200 million years old. NARRATOR: As the dead plants\nwere transformed to coal on land, the shallow waters\nsurrounding the continents were preserving\nmillions of generations of dead marine organisms. They would become our other\nmajor fossil fuels, oil and gas. Every year, mankind minds\nalmost 5,000 megatons of coal, 30 billion barrels of oil,\nand 3,000 billion cubic meters of gas. This fertile period\nof Earth history has given us much of\nthe energy we use today. Without it, the\nIndustrial Revolution may never have happened. [music playing] Plants were not alone in\nmaking a new life on the land 300 million years ago. As time went on, first,\nenormous insects, then, ambitious amphibians, and\nfinally, early reptilians left the seas to take\ntheir first steps on the muddy shorelines. The US east coast\nback then would have teamed with monsters,\n3 foot millipedes on land, 2 foot dragonflies in the air,\nand protoalligators patrolling the nearby waters. The world was over 4 and\n1/4 billion years old, and for the first\ntime, the surface was host to a complete\nmodern biosphere. [music playing] But the all-conquering\nlife forms were about to experience\na hell on Earth. Forces deep within were about\nto give life on the surface its sternest test ever. Enormous volcanic\neruptions would herald the biggest mass\nextinction in the planet's entire history. [music playing] 250 million years ago. For hundreds of millions of\nyears, life on the surface had faced numerous\nchallenges to its survival, but nothing on the scale of\nwhat was about to happen. [music playing] In what would one\nday become Siberia, the Earth's crust became\na volcanic morass. The cause was a rare\nmantle plume eruption. No one knows for\nsure why they occur, but occasionally, huge masses\nof hot mantle from deep within the Earth surge upwards,\nmelting and smashing the crust above. The eruptions continued\nfor over one million years. They spewed out over 1 million\ncubic miles of molten rock, enough to bury the modern USA\nin a layer over 1,000 feet. Clouds of poisonous\ngases spread out and shrouded the entire globe. It was too much for\nmost species of life. Over 95% were driven\nto extinction. [music playing] It was the most\ncataclysmic event the planet has ever witnessed. The planet that emerged from\nthe chaos was much changed. A new supercontinent, the\ngreat Pangea, now dominated. And the climate was\naltering dramatically. Over the next 200 million\nyears, oxygen and carbon dioxide would rise to new peaks,\nand under these conditions, the animals that had\nsurvived the extinction were to evolve into the most\ninfamous creatures ever to walk the Earth, the dinosaurs. [music playing] Utah, USA. Paleontologist Reese Barrick\nis on the hunt for dinosaurs. In this dusty corner\nof the western USA, the rocks are packed\nwith their bones. REESE BARRICK: Almost 1/3 of the\nhistory of life on this planet was dominated by dinosaurs. It really, truly is\na dinosaur planet. We have, from the\nbottom of this slope, sediments that are\n150 million years, and as you go up the\nslope, you actually end up in the Cretaceous\nat 125 million years. [music playing] How we doing, Barb? Doing great. Find anything fun? Small rib and some\ninteresting fragments. Well, let's start for the day. NARRATOR: Compared\nto modern creatures, dinosaurs were enormous. The average mammal today\nis smaller than a dog. The average dinosaur was\nlarger than a grizzly bear. [growling, music playing] Marvin, excellent,\nlook at that. That is a spectacular\ntherizinosaur claw. This animal's gonna have\nto be 300 kilograms, so it's about the size of\na national football league lineman. These are absolutely\nfantastic, because they're very well-preserved bone. A perfect claw. Absolutely brilliant, Marvin. Nice job. [music playing] NARRATOR: The first\nrecorded dinosaur fossil find was a bone discovered\nby young Mary Ann Mantell in England in 1822. Her husband, Dr. Gideon\nMantell, was intrigued, and set about determining what type\nof creature it belonged to. The fossil was unlike\nanything he'd ever seen. After much research, he decided\nit was, in fact, a tooth from an enormous lizard. He named the beast iguanodon,\nafter the iguana lizard he thought it resembled. Over the next few decades,\nacross Europe and the USA, more and more huge\nbones were unearthed, and given their similarity\nto modern lizards, the name dinosaur, meaning\nterrible lizard, was coined. [music playing, growling] But many paleontologists\ntoday believe one of the reasons\ndinosaurs grew so large was that they weren't\ncold-blooded like today's lizards. They were lukewarm-blooded. This gave them the advantages\nof both cold-blooded lizards and warm-blooded mammals. REESE BARRICK: Dinosaurs were\nable to be active and collect food all year long, and yet,\nthey could put a great amount of the food that the ate towards\ngrowing as opposed to just heat generation. NARRATOR: But another\nreason for their size may have been the sweltering\noxygen-rich environment that came to dominate\nthe dinosaur era, an environment\ntriggered by volcanism. [music playing] Starting around 180\nmillion years ago, a new upsurge in\nvolcanic activity split apart the supercontinent. The continental fragments\nbegan their long journeys into the positions\nthey occupy today. North America, South America,\nAfrica, and Europe all went their separate ways. The Pangean supercontinent\nwas no more. Each of the new continents\nstill carried dinosaurs, and the steamy volcanic\nclimate seemed to suit them. It was global warming gone wild. CO2 levels increased over\n500%, and temperatures soared. In the greenhouse\nconditions this created, huge tropical forests spread\nacross many of the continents. REESE BARRICK: The\nincreasing amount of tropics means that there's a lot more\nlush vegetation, which means there's a lot more food for\ndinosaurs, which allowed them not only to specialize\nand evolve to specialize on different types\nof plant materials, but allowed them to\nget extremely large. NARRATOR: Many\nscientists believe that evolving for\nmillions of years in this warm,\noxygen-rich world allowed the lukewarm-blooded dinosaurs\nto reach their enormous sizes. Huge dinosaurs may have\nbeen a biological response to a volcanically\noveractive planet. But size would not\nsave the dinosaurs from what was to come. Their time on Earth would\nend in sudden, unstoppable devastation. [music playing, explosion] 100 million years ago, planet\nEarth was ruled by dinosaurs. Huge beasts filled the\nland, the sea, and the air. They lived in a\nsweltering world defined by overactive volcanism. And before it was\nfinished, this volcanism would bring to the surface\nsome of the planet's most wondrous riches, diamonds. [music playing] Kimberley, South Africa. Jock Robey is chief geologist\nat De Beers, the largest diamond company in the world. JOCK ROBEY: Diamond is\nsimply the high pressure form of the element carbon. This is a typical eight-sided\ncrystal called on octahedron. Uncut, it is worth\n$2,000 a carat. As a cut stone, it would\nprobably sell for $80,000. NARRATOR: For\nthousands of years, diamonds had been found\nworldwide washed up in sandy riverbanks,\nbut their source had remained a total mystery. It was not until 1869 that huge,\nunique diamond discoveries were made in South Africa that their\nremarkable origin was revealed. JOCK ROBEY: What is special\nabout the diamonds found in the Kimberley area is\nhere, for the first time ever, they found a source\nrock of diamonds. This is a piece of rock\nmined from the Kimberlite, and as we turn it, it\ncontains a diamond. NARRATOR: The\ndiamond-bearing rock was extracted from strange\nvertical formations. JOCK ROBEY: As the\nminers were digging, they found that the\ndiamonds were contained in the body of rock that had\na shape of an ice cream cone. Slightly broad at the\nsurface, yellow in color, tapering down to\na narrower point. [music playing] NARRATOR: Henry Carvill Lewis, a\nvisiting American mineralogist, put together the pieces. He realized these diamond\nmines were actually the mouths of ancient volcanoes. The miners were digging\ndown into their roots through the diamond-bearing\nmagma that remained. But these were clearly\nnot normal volcanoes. They were over\nthree times deeper, extending nearly 100\nmiles beneath the surface of the continent. Uniquely intense pressures\nand temperatures at this depth make it the only place\nthat diamonds can form. The diamonds could\nonly be brought up by uniquely intense eruptions. The diamond-bearing magma\nexploded out of the Earth at over 300 miles an hour. Imagine the force and\nthe power of this volcano to cut the sheer vertical walls\nand blow this up another 1,000 meters. This is the power\nof these volcanoes. [music playing] NARRATOR: When the Pangean\nsupercontinent split apart over 100 million years\nago, scientists believe the enormous\nupheaval triggered these super eruptions. Because super continental\nbreakups are rare, so are the diamonds they\nbring to the surface. The diamonds that erupted\ninto the dinosaur world would survive unblemished\nuntil the present day. But the dinosaurs\nwould not be so lucky. [music playing] 65 million years ago. The planet was lush. Vegetation was thick\non the surface. Living things were\nprospering like never before. But the dominant dinosaurs\nwere about to be wiped from the face of the planet. REESE BARRICK: Dinosaur\nbones are found continuously throughout the\nsedimentary record from 230 million years ago,\nright up to 65 million years ago, and then\ninstantaneously, they vanish. NARRATOR: Not only dinosaurs,\nbut over 70% of species on Earth disappear. From plant life upward,\nsomething terrible had happened to the entire\necosystem of the planet. [music playing] This mass extinction\nremained a mystery for generations of\npaleontologists. But it is a mystery no longer. Colorado, USA. Dan Durda is taking samples\nfrom an exposed layer of rock exactly 65 million years old. Scientists now believe\nthat it holds the answer. For Dan Durda, this powdery\nrock is an indication that the dinosaurs perished\nin a sudden astronomical catastrophe. Dinosaurs and 75% of all\nthe other plants and animals that lived with them, this\nlayer is their tombstone. This thin layer of clay\nis the important evidence of a violent event in the\nhistory of life on the planet. NARRATOR: The evidence\nheld in the tombstone layer is a huge amount of an\nexceptionally rare element, iridium. The remarkable\nconcentration of iridium was discovered\naccidentally in 1980 by a father and son team of\nscientists, Lewis and Walter Alvarez. On the planet's surface,\niridium is usually found in very small concentrations. Most of this rare element\noriginates from space rock deposited from the\nmultitude of small meteors vaporizing in the upper\natmosphere every day. The Alvarezs were looking for\nvariations in the strength of these tiny meteor showers,\nbut when they realized this huge concentration was\nheld in the infamous tombstone layer, they proposed a radical\nnew theory for the extinction, death from above. The dinosaur planet had been\nhit by an enormous meteor. Their theory remained\ncontroversial for over 10 years, until the final\npiece of the puzzle was discovered in Mexico,\na hidden crater over 100 miles across. DAN DURDA: In 1990, the\nChicxulub impact crater was discovered, and its\nage, when finally dated, turned out to be precisely\n65 million years old. It turned out to be it was the\nsmoking gun for the Alvarez theory. NARRATOR: Worldwide,\nthe tombstone layer contains an estimated\n200,000 tons of iridium. This translates to a meteor\nover 6 miles in diameter. Its impact on the planet\nwould have been devastating. You've got to imagine\nMount Everest flying at you across the sky at\n20 kilometers per second. [music playing] Several thousand cubic\nkilometers of the Earth's crust were vaporized and\nexcavated and watched around the entire planet,\nslowly raining back down through the atmosphere to settle\nacross the surface of the Earth as a thin layer of\ndust and debris. NARRATOR: But the meteor was not\nalone in wreaking destruction. Today, in India, ancient lava\nflows exist that are so thick, whole temples have been\ncarved into their layers. The lavas were the result\nof a massive eruption that was occurring simultaneously\nwith the meteor strike. Although not as extensive as\nthe earlier Siberian eruptions, these lava flows in Western\nIndia could have buried the USA to a depth of over 600 feet. The huge clouds of\ntoxic dust they produced would have rivaled\nthose of the meteor. 65 million years ago, the\nmeteor impact and the eruptions would have been a\ndeadly double blow. Whichever had the\nstronger effect, the combination of these\nevents sounded the death knell for the dinosaurs. [MUSIC PLAYING, DINOSAURS\nROARING] The dust cloud lingering\nhigh in the upper atmosphere and blocking the Sun\ndevastated the life below. The huge dinosaurs, along\nwith most other major species, were extinct. The new world that\nwas to follow would be the world of the mammals,\nand the world of man. [music playing] 50 million years ago. Life was slowly recovering after\nthe cataclysmic extinction that obliterated the dinosaurs. The Earth had been around\nfor over 4.4 billion years, but only now were the first\nmammals, our ancestors, beginning to flourish. Long before humans\narrived, the continents continued to move and\ncrash into one another. Slowly, but surely, the surface\nstarted to look familiar as plate tectonics and erosion\ncreated the dramatic landscapes we see today. [music playing] The Swiss Alps. Some mountain chains can be\nexplained by volcanic eruption of rock from the\ndepths of the Earth, but the greatest, including the\nAlps, contained no volcanoes. They appear to have risen as\nif by magic, up from the plains beneath. This famous range runs\nthrough the heart of Europe and reaches over 3\nmiles above sea level. How was such a huge mass\nof rock pushed up so high? Adrian Pfiffner is an expert\non the structure of the Alpine chain, and he knows the answer. ADRIAN PFIFFNER: The scene\nwe see in front of us is the result of a collision\nbetween two continents, the African continent and\nthe European continent. [music playing] NARRATOR: A close study\nof the Alpine rocks can provide clear evidence of\nhow the mountains were formed. The secret is revealed\nin quartz crystals that are extremely small. ADRIAN PFIFFNER: These\nslices are about 20/1000 of a millimeter. At that thickness, you see\nthrough one single grain. NARRATOR: The tiny\ncrystals in the rock revealed massive deformation. The quartz grains have been\nreally stretched, elongated, and flattened. You need large stresses in\norder to deform these rocks. One process that is doing\nthis is actually the collision of two continental plates. NARRATOR: For the\nlast 45 million years, as the continents have\ncontinued to move, the African plate and subplates\nhave been grinding into Europe. The continental crust\nalong the collision point experiences extreme\npressure, and the solid rock itself is warped and buckled. If you assume that my\nhands are two plates which are squeezing the\nrocks in between, you can see that some\nof the material escapes upwards and leads to the\nbuilding of a mountain. NARRATOR: The twisted\nfolds of the rock strata are exposed as the\nmountains are slowly squeezed higher and higher. One famous Alpine mountain\ndemonstrates clearly this collision of the\nAfrican and European continental plates,\nthe Matterhorn. The Matterhorn is the\nchild of two continents. ADRIAN PFIFFNER: What's\namazing about the Matterhorn is the top pyramid\nof the Matterhorn is a piece of Africa,\nand it lies on Europe. NARRATOR: In the formation\nof this classic mountain, the two continental plates\nhave actually overlapped. ADRIAN PFIFFNER: You can\nthink of a car crash. If two cars crash\nwith each other, maybe one car slides\nover the other one. The two continents\nmoved together, and Africa moved\non top of Europe. NARRATOR: Plate tectonics are\nresponsible for all the Earth's mountain ranges, and over\nmillions of years of growth, the only thing that has\nstopped them grinding inexorably skywards is\nerosion, erosion by snow, wind, and rain. This is the action of water\nthat is eroding the mountains. Now, this might seem to\nbe something very small, but actually, if you look\nat the entire Swiss Alps, 50 million tons is\neroded every year, and this corresponds to a\nsmall mountain roughly 1,000 meters high, one every year. [music playing] NARRATOR: The height of\nmountains around the world are determined by these\ntwo opposing forces, uplift and erosion, changing them\nby fractions of an inch up or down each year. But plate movement\nand water erosion can also create the\nopposite of a mountain. Under the right\nconditions, the surface itself can be cut away,\nsometimes, spectacularly. [music playing] The Grand Canyon, over 1 mile\ndeep, 10 miles wide, 277 miles long, and still growing. WAYNE RANNEY: One of the\ngreat stories of exploration is when the first Europeans saw\nthe Grand Canyon in the year 1541. And a couple of those\nmen came over to the rim, they saw the river\ndown below, and they thought it was 6 feet wide. The explorer sent a\ncouple of his men down, and they came back later and\nsaid the canyon is deeper than it looks. NARRATOR: Wayne\nRaney is an expert on this geological phenomenon. Its unique scale,\nthe consequence of titanic forces of nature. Over the course of the\nlast six million years, this spectacular canyon has\nbeen carved by the slow, winding Colorado\nRiver, in combination with dramatic uplifting\nof the Colorado Plateau. [music playing] Plate tectonic processes\nhave pushed the whole plateau upwards. It now lies over 8,000\nfeet above sea level. WAYNE RANNEY: This\nuplift probably occurred with the Pacific plate coming\ninto the North American plate and wrinkling the crust. Much like if you took a\nthrow rug on a hardwood floor and pushed it along\nthe hardwood floor, when the edge of that\nrug reaches the wall, you'll see this big\nbow up in the rug, and that's exactly what's\nhappened to the western edge of North America. NARRATOR: The river looks too\nsmall to cut a canyon so deep, but its height above sea level\nmeans that the force of gravity gives it great power. WAYNE RANNEY: All you have\nto do is look at big rivers like the Amazon or\nthe Mississippi. They have much more\nvolume of water than the Colorado River\ndoes, and yet, they don't cut large canyons,\nbecause their landscape is not elevated. So uplift brings the rocks into\nan elevation where the river can then saw down through\nall of those layers and create the canyon\nlandscape we see today. NARRATOR: Plate tectonics\ncombined with erosion have sculpted many\nof the features on the surface of our planet,\nand as a general rule, the most jagged, tallest peaks\nand the deepest canyons are the youngest of\nthese grand structures, all formed within the\nlast 50 million years. But the final touches\nhave been added by yet another major force of nature. Two million years\nago, in East Africa, ancestors of modern humans\nwere taking their first steps on Earth. At the same time, down\nfrom the North Pole, enormous, icy glaciers\nbegan to descend. The Earth was about\nto enter the ice ages. [music playing] Two million years ago,\nancestors of modern humans had begun to spread\nout of Africa. But the earth around\nthem was cooling down. Before long, much\nof the planet would be coated in huge glaciers. The ice ages had arrived. [music playing] The grand freezings\nwere triggered when overflowing\nvolcanoes in Panama created the land bridge\njoining north to South America, and radically altered\nglobal ocean currents. The polar seas\ncooled significantly. The result was that pronounced\ndips in global temperature could now tip the planet\ninto ice ages lasting tens of thousands of years. [music playing] The Langjokull Glacier. In the highest, coldest\nparts of the planet, glaciers still reign supreme. Few venture out in\nthese hostile terrains, but glacier climatologist\nFinnur Palsson and his team regularly battled the\nfreezing elements. FINNUR PALSSON: When you're\ndoing glacier field work, conditions can be very bad. NARRATOR: Outside, it is below\nminus 20 degrees Fahrenheit. FINNUR PALSSON: I like to\nwork in harsh conditions. Difficulty is something\nyou need to tackle. NARRATOR: Finnur is keeping tabs\non the growth of the glacier. At present, it is\nover 350 square miles, the size of New York City. And although it may\nlook static, in fact, it is in constant motion. Glaciers are formed initially\nby snowfall on high areas. The compacted ice\nis then dragged down by the force of gravity. The glaciers move like\nslow motion rivers. FINNUR PALSSON: You\ncan think of ice as soft material, like\ntoothpaste, flows. If you would make a big block\nof toothpaste on a plate, it will slowly sink down\nand flow away to the edges. NARRATOR: Finnur and\nhis team in Iceland regularly check on the\nincremental movement of the ice. This is a satellite\npositioning system. You can calculate the\nposition of this point with an accuracy of\nabout 2 centimeters to calculate how fast\nthe glacier moves. NARRATOR: Finnur's\nmeasurements tell him that this glacier is moving\nat over 150 feet per year. In today's mild\ntemperatures, glacial advance is kept in check\nby glacial melting. But if global temperatures were\nto drop by just a few degrees for a long period,\nthen the glaciers would grind slowly\nforward, and the Earth would enter another ice age. The existence of\nice ages was first discovered by 19th century\nSwiss geologist Louis Agassiz. As he explored the\nSwiss Alps in the 1830s, Agassiz couldn't help but notice\nthe immense boulders scattered over farmland, and the bizarre\ntowers of gravel capped by stones that stood guard over\nsome of the mountain valleys. To explain how the rocks\narrived at these positions, he speculated that\nthey had been carried and deposited by ancient\nglaciers that had once filled the Alpine\nvalleys and covered the northern hemisphere. Initially ridiculed\nby his peers, Agassiz's ice age theory became\naccepted as telltale signs that these huge glaciers had\nindeed covered the continents were found all over the globe. The evidence is everywhere. [music playing] New York's Central Park. This oasis of green in\nthe middle of Manhattan exposes part of the\nisland's ancient bedrock. Many large outcrops are visible,\nand they contain the footprints of the glaciers. [music playing] Climate expert Joerg Schaeffer\nis looking for subtle traces of this frozen world. JOERG SCHAEFFER: It's\nactually something I bet that most New\nYorkers do not know. You see the ice ages everywhere\nif you open your eyes. NARRATOR: Look closely,\nand the super hard bedrock is marked with scores\nof tiny parallel lines fractions of an inch deep. So this point here is actually\none of the most amazing spots of evidence for an ice age in\nthe middle of New York City. NARRATOR: The grooves were\ncaused by small rocks caught under the massive weight\nof a moving glacier. These little rocks\nbasically cut like a knife into this very hard bedrock. This is clear proof that\nonce, enormous ice sheet was moving in this direction\nin the middle of New York City. [music playing] NARRATOR: The glaciers that\nhit New York were massive. They rolled down from the\narctic and buried Manhattan under a huge depth of ice. JOERG SCHAEFFER: To give you\nan idea about the thickness of the Laurentide ice sheet\nin the Manhattan area, it was at least twice as thick\nas the Empire State Building's height today. NARRATOR: Over the\nlast two million years, as the climate fluctuated,\nthe huge ice sheets waxed and waned. With every pass, they gouged and\ncrushed and reshaped the land beneath them. As the last glaciers\nretreated 10,000 years ago, they left behind a bruised\nand battered landscape, and created features\nwe still see today. In the USA, Cape\nCod and Long Island are built on immense\npiles of boulders dropped from the retreating edge of\nthe North American ice sheet. And the great weight of the ice\nformed huge depressions that now make up the Great Lakes. In the warmer\nclimate that followed the last glacial\nretreat, early humans had free reign over the surface. [music playing] In this brief period, a\nfraction of a fraction of 1% of the history\nof the Earth, the entire history of human\ncivilization, has taken place. Human ingenuity has\nreshaped our planet. From our perspective, our\nachievements are breathtaking. But will we continue\nto survive and prosper? Humans have, with technology,\ndominated the planet more completely than perhaps did\nany other animal in the history of-- of life, but we've done it for\nsuch a short period of time that we've got a\nlong ways to go. NARRATOR: Over the\npast 4.5 billion years, the Earth has been on the\nmost incredible journey. Over the eons of its existence,\nthe planetary environment has undergone immense\ntransformations. And since the arrival of\nlife, these transformations have, in many ways, determined\nwhich organisms will survive, and which will be swept aside. If this turbulent past is\nany guide to the future, life, and humans in particular,\nwill face further battles for survival as the\nplanet continues along its path of change. Life is highly\ndependent on the Earth. What the Earth gives us is\nwhat we have to deal with. It's hard to\nseparate completely the processes of geology\nand the processes of life. Life, in some ways,\ndrives geology, and geology creates the\nenvironments in which life thrives. NARRATOR: Our first major\nchallenge will be the climate. At the start of\nthe 21st century, we may worry about\nglobal warming, but most scientists\nrecognize that we are in a gap between ice ages. Our whole civilization\nhas occurred in a brief warm period,\n10,000 years so far. This warmth has proved crucial. It's definitely\nnot a coincidence that civilizations developed\nover this period of time because the climate is so\nfavorable to our species to develop and flourish. The period we live in the moment\nclimate wise, over the last, let's say, 10,000 years,\nis exceptionally stable. It's almost unbelievably\nstable if you-- if you look into the\ngeological record. It certainly will not\nstay forever like that. NARRATOR: Even if our\nindustrial economies affected global warming over the\nnext couple of centuries, it can do no more than\ndelay the inevitable. The continent's\ncurrent positions keeping the polar oceans cool\nmean that in just 15,000 years, a new ice age may occur. MARK MCMENAMIN:\nThe New York area is going to be\ncompletely changed by the next cycle of\nglaciation, and at some point, glaciers are going to move\ndown and grind New York into the North Atlantic Ocean. NARRATOR: But even if we\nsurvive the big freezes, there will be greater\nchallenges to come. As plate tectonics\nmove the continents and end the ice ages, coastal\nregions will be engulfed, and whole countries\nwill disappear. 200 million years from\nnow, a new supercontinent, Pangaea Altima, is due\nto take shape, as first the Mediterranean, and\nthen the Atlantic Ocean are swallowed up. There will be\ncontinents eventually colliding with the east\ncoast of North America, so New York, in the long\nrun, will be destroyed in a continent to\ncontinent collision and will be completely\ncrushed and thrust upward as a new mountain range. NARRATOR: The earth\nwill once again be thrown into deadly turmoil. Oxygen levels and\nsurface temperatures could fluctuate wildly and\nlead to new mass extinctions. But even the trauma of\nsuper continental disruption is nothing compared\nto what will follow. Everything will grind to a halt\nwhen the plate tectonic engine finally stops. The maintenance of\nhabitability of this planet is involved with a\nplate tectonics cycle. It's not an infinite cycle. There is an end in sight. It's billions of years from\nnow, but we know, eventually, the system will wear out. NARRATOR: The fires in the\ndepths that have dominated activity on the surface will\none day use up their fuel, and the story of planet\nEarth will be over. Without its burning\nheart, the Earth will share what many believe\nwas the fate of Mars. The atmosphere and oceans\nwill be stripped away, and the surface will become\na bone dry, barren desert. The planet will be dead. But this is a picture of an\nincredibly distant future. For at least the next billion\nyears, as the Earth continues its epic journey, some form\nof life should continue. But the human species, which\nhave walked the Earth for over two million years, and mastered\nit only in the last 10,000, may be endangered. As the environment transforms,\nEarth could well become unfit for humans. If that happens in\nthe distant future, rather than be forced\nto face extinction like our predecessors,\ntechnology may allow us to leave Earth\nin search of new homes, other blue-green planets on\nwhich to make a new start, leaving planet Earth to continue\nits amazing journey without us."

        "transcription": "just east of the community of Walnut Creek California lies a place of absolute beauty splendor and geological interest Mount Diablo though this mountain has a devilish name it's far from a devilish place in my opinion it's one of the most beautiful locations in the greater San Francisco Bay area and if you're a nature lover its lush slopes will offer you pure happiness home to beautiful oak forests stunning wild flowers and a surprising array of biodiversity Mount Diablo rises 3,849 ft above sea level standing tall above the East Bay the mountain regales an eventful geological history that sheds light on the greater geology of the San Francisco Bay area and of California in general mount Diablo is unique in that in a sense you could say that it just like many people moved to California but how in this episode of Solomon's Outdoor Adventures we're going to explain how as we explore the fascinating geology of Mount Diablo the mountain that moved to California let's do it mount Diablo is composed of a complex suite of interesting rocks ranging in age from about 200 million to 4.83 million years old the lion's share of Mount Diablo's rocks are Jurassic and Cretaceous in age and are a part of a large unit known as the Franciscan complex the Franciscan complex is a metamorphosed suite of greywacky sandstone shale conglomerate basaltt ch serpentanite eklloite and blue shest it's an example of an exotic terrain that was accreted onto the western margin of the North American continent in geology an exotic terrain is a large unit of rocks that was formed in a different place than it is currently outcropped in having moved to its current location via tectonic processes this means that the core of Mount Diablo is made of rocks that originated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean 200 to 70 million years ago and were sutured onto the west coast of North America that's fine and dandy but how exactly did that happen if you've watched any of my other California geology videos you've definitely heard me talk about the Mesazoic aged subduction zone that involves the Fereralon plate subducting beneath a North American plate to recap subduction zones are convergent plate boundaries where a denser oceanic plate dives or subducts beneath a lighter continental plate this process creates three main land forms: volcanic arcs forearch basins and accretionary wedges in my video on the geology of the Sierra Nevada we discussed the volcanic arc of the ancient Fereralon subduction zone in great detail in my video on the geology of the Sutterbutes we largely talked about the forarch basin of the affforementioned ancient subduction zone in this video we're going to talk all about the accretionary wedge of this messoic aged subduction zone as the rocks of Mount Diablo are largely composed of this accretionary wedge accretionary wedges are defined as chains of mountains or hills parallel to the main fault of a subduction zone that are composed of rock that's been scraped off of the subducting oceanic plate onto the continental plate on Mount Diablo itself there are two particular rock units that constitute this accretionary wedge the Mount Diablo Oilite and the affforementioned Franciscan complex the Mount Diablo of is a Jurassic aged unit that formed between 161 and 172 million years ago composed of ignous basalt and gabro as well as metamorphic serpentanite the Mount Diablo of Oilite is a subunit of the much larger coast range of which outcrops throughout the coast ranges between Santa Barbara and the Clamoth Mountains oily are defined as sheets of oceanic crust and mantle material that have been tectonically uplifted and thrust above sea level onto the margins of a continent the coast range of is one of the most extensive ofite sequences in North America extending for over 435 mi and composing pretty much the entirety of the basement rock of California west of the Sierra Nevada these widespread in California were formed via a process known as abduction in geology abduction is a rare process that occurs at convergent plate boundaries where rather than diving beneath the continental plate parts of the oceanic plate override the continental plate depositing rocks on the continental plate and building mountains composed of oceanic crust in the process of doing so this occurred during the beginning stages of the convergence of the Fereralon and North American plates as abduction of the Fereralon plate occurred the uppermost sections of it were scraped off and thrusted onto the continental North American plate this included basaltt and gabro from the ancient Feralon plate the abducted oceanic crust was subjected to strong compressive forces crumpling up and becoming highly folded hydraysis of basaltt and gabro at low temperatures and high pressures brought on by these compressive forces occurred metamorphosing significant amounts of basaltt and gabro into serpentinite the mount diablo of outcrops on the northern slopes of Mount Diablo the Franciscan complex is a metamorphosed suite of chreywacky sandstone shale conglomerate basaltt serpentanite ekloite and blue shist many geologists simply refer to this diverse array of rocks that compose the Franciscan complex as milange the Franciscan complex is highly solicified due in large part to silicarrich exoskeletons of plankton in the ancient Pacific Ocean dying and falling to the seafloor this silica from the plankton exoskeletons then incorporated itself into the sediments of the Mesazoic Pacific Ocean forming the CH of the Franciscan complex gray wacky sandstone formed as underwater landslides from the continental shelf of Mesazoic North America carried debris into the deeper parts of the ocean and were rapidly deposited the shale of the Franciscan complex was formed as fine grained sediments carried into the ocean by rivers were compacted and lithified the Franciscan complex formed over a time frame of about 140 million years throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods while the Mount Diablo of formed in only 10 million years during the mid Jurassic period the Franciscan complex comprises the summit and main core of Mount Diablo surrounding the accreted terrains that form the core and northern section of Mount Diablo lie a sedimentary unit known as the Great Valley Sequence that much like the Franciscan complex dates back to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods the Great Valley Sequence is thick and I mean thick AF it has a maximum thickness of 62,000 ft and is composed of deep marine shells sandstones and conglomerates the great valley sequence is stratographically above the affforementioned Franciscan complex and Mount Diablo ofite and was deposited when what would become the central valley was under the ocean on Mount Diablo the most ubiquitous layer of the great valley sequence is the Jurassic Knoxville formation on Mount Diablo the Paleogene and Neoene period saw the deposition of sedimentary and volcanic rocks mainly sandstones and volcanic toughs these sandstones were mainly deposited in the Paleocene and measene epics and are both marine and non-marine in origin forming from the compaction and lithification of sand that eroded off of the Sierra Nevada Ark throughout the last 60 million years these sandstones are common on the south side of Mount Diablo and a place where you can really enjoy them firsthand is Rock City 9 million-year-old stream deposits on the south side of the mountain have yielded excellent fossils including horses camels rhinos and gumpers the youngest of the units on Mount Diablo is the 4.83 millionyear-old Lawler Tough which actually sheds light on the uplift history of Mount Diablo beautifully you see the Lawler tough was deposited in a flat landscape but today the Lawler tough is highly folded this suggests that Mount Diablo must have been uplifted within the last 4.83 million years after the tough was deposited so how exactly did these rocks that comprise Mount Diablo go from being 20,000 ft below the ocean to the top of one of the most prominent mountains around San Francisco let's answer that now though accretion of the Mount Diablo ofite and Franciscan complex occurred during the Mesazoic era this was largely a submarine process as there's no evidence that these rocks were above sea level during the Jurassic or Cretaceous periods one salient line of evidence that suggests that these rocks were never above sea level until recently is that the Franciscan complex was metamorphosed after deposition this means it had to have been buried by at least 12 miles in order to have undergone metamorphosis both the Franciscan complex and Mount Diablo of were buried and overlaining by the thick AF Great Valley sequence during the late Cretaceous and early Paleo gene periods localized extension commenced causing the underlying Franciscan complex and coast range of to uplift these terrains were exumed from a depth of 12 miles to a depth of 2 m below the Earth's surface though this was enough to bring these accreted terrains 10 miles closer to the surface of the Earth it didn't last long enough to build Mount Diablo everything changed 4 million years ago when the current big boss in charge of the area the San Andreas fault had something to say about it the San Andreas fault is a strike slip fault that denotes the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates here the Pacific and North American plates slide past each other the Pacific heads northwest and the North American south though the San Andreas fault is the main fault here the plate boundary is not a simple one fault deal in an ideal world the Pacific and North American plates would seamlessly slide past each other at the San Andreas fault but we all know that this world is far from ideal instead of just seamlessly sliding past each other the two plates often get stuck together this not only causes earthquakes but it also causes other faults associated with the San Andreas to form in an attempt to alleviate more pressure and not be so stuck as such rather than one seamless one fault plate boundary the Pacific North American boundary in California is really a transition zone of sorts with several active faults associated with the San Andreas that run through the area including but not limited to the Hayward Calaveris and Greenville faults among others each one of these faults accommodates some motion between the two affforementioned tectonic plates and while the majority of them are strike slip the friction between the Pacific and North American plates also causes thrust faults to form as the two tectonic plates need to go somewhere and if they can't slide past one another another option is going up this is exactly how Mount Diablo is formed within the last 4 million years Mount Diablo has been tirelessly uplifted by the Mount Diablo and the Los Madanos Row Island blind thrust faults two faults associated with the restraining bend between the Greenville and Concord faults blind thrust faults are thrust faults that do not surface hence the blind terminology restraining bends are features in strikes faults where the strikes fault bends in a way that causes compression resulting in localized uplift these processes built the modern Mount Diablo and brought the Franciscan complex and Mount Diablo of to the surface of the earth from their depth of 2 mi below the earth intensely folding them on the way up uplift continues today at a rate of about 2 mm per year that may not sound significant to your human mind but geologically speaking that's fast as hell it's no secret that the San Francisco Bay area is a very seismically active location and the uplift of Mount Diablo is testament to the active plate tectonics of the area the USGS postulates a 4% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or stronger earthquake on the faults associated with Mount Diablo within the next 30 years though this figure is pretty low according to UC Berkeley there's a 63% chance that the San Francisco Bay area in general will experience a magnitude 6.7 or stronger earthquake within the next 10 years an absolutely sobering stat in addition to interesting rocks and active faults Mount Diablo is home to its fair share of minable commodities notably mercury and coal the whole time I was visiting Mount Diablo to film this video I was thinking why the hell would they call this Devil Mountain it's a beautiful place but I guess mercury and coal are two toxic compounds that may as well be from hell so I guess it makes sense anyways I digress the real reason why it's called Mount Diablo is because when the Spanish did their whole military campaign stuff they lost track of a group of Miwok Native Americans in a thicket on the mountain and in classic concisador fashion attributed the Native Americans escape to the devil's work so they named the mountain Monte del Diablo or Thicket of the Devil it eventually just turned into Mount Diablo or devil mountain anyways back to the materials from hell mercury and coal mercury was mined on the northeast side of the mountain in the 1900s extracted from the minerals cineabar and metacinabar native Americans traditionally mined mercury in the area before Europeans did using the red cinnabar for ceremonial purposes mercury ore occurs in the fault zones that separate the Franciscan complex from the great valley sequence deposited by hydrothermal hotring deposits mercury here was quote unquote discovered by a man named Welch in 1863 but it wasn't extensively mined in the area until the 1930s when demand for it greatly increased due to World War II in 1958 mercury production ceased but acid mine drainage continues to pollute and contaminate Marsh Creek leading to the abandoned Mount Diablo mercury mine being designated an EPA super fund site all in all about $1.5 million worth of mercury was mined from Mount Diablo coal was another commodity that was extensively mined on Mount Diablo interestingly enough Mount Diablo is home to one of California's largest coal deposits the Mount Diablo coal field was the largest coal mining district in California producing roughly 4 million tons of coal from 1860 to 1914 valued at roughly 15 to 20 million this coal was used extensively in urban and industrial centers in San Francisco and the greater San Francisco Bay area but the mines closed as cheaper and more environmentally friendly sources of fuel were utilized despite its satanic name Mount Diablo is an absolutely beautiful place with an interesting and varied geologic history the mountain records 200 million years worth of California geology including accreted terrains sedimentary units active faults as well as mercury and coal deposits it's a significant peak in the East Bay and I highly recommend visiting and enjoying its beautiful slopes hopefully you

trail of geological Mysteries behind this episode Journeys back through time to explore how ice has shaped modern North America geologists discover how America's temperatures plunged to an average of 26¬∞ F all year round how a wall of ice 8 times the height of the Empire State Building covered much of North America and how ice created some of the country's most stunning geological wonders a deep Frozen episode in the continuing drama of how the Earth was [Music] made one awesome physical Force has had more impact than any other on the shaping of modern North America the dynamic Unstoppable power of ice over millions of years ice sheets a mile or more thick have decapitated ated the continent's mountains and Damned and diverted its rivers but the full extent of how ice has carved and sculpted the landscape of the US is only now becoming clear as scientists investigate the overwhelming geological impact of America's Ice Age for centuries American early geologists were puzzled by mysterious marks etched into the Bedrock of much of North America and by Lonely mounds of rock randomly scattered across the land many believed such features were evidence of a massive flood in the long distant past but then in 1847 a newly appointed Harvard University Professor came up with a radical new idea geologist Louie aases compared North America's landscape and rocks with the geology of mountain glaciers in his native Switzerland and he built on theories he had developed in the Swiss Alps a decade earlier to declare that North America had once been buried deep under ice agy's work at Harvard made him world famous in his day but the final proof of his Ice Age Theory had to wait until the 1950s when new evidence came from the seabed of the Atlantic [Music] Ocean that evidence is still stored to this day in this refrigerated laboratory at Miami University these thousands of plastic tubes offer scientists a unique window to look back at what the weather was like on the ancient Earth these records which you see in this room here basically are the primary information we have now about the climate changes we have had over the last 2 million years so these are really what the starting points that open people's eyes about uh changes which occurred during glacial periods the mud cores were collected by oceanographer Cesar emiliani the deeper he drilled the further back in time he went and the they older the sample he pulled to the surface these are cores of deep sea mud and within the mud are small organisms which record the temperature and the salinity and the other conditions which were prevalent when that organism lived those tiny undersea creatures are called foraminifer their chemical makeup varies depending on the the temperature of the water in which they grow so the seab bugs in different layers of mud act as Tiny thermometers recording how hot or cold the Earth was at different times in its past they revealed that just over 2 million years ago the average annual temperature across the lower 48 states was around 56¬∞ F about 3¬∞ warmer than it is [Music] today then the temperature regularly started crashing below zero and staying there for month after month huge changes happened with what in geological terms was astonishing speed within 10,000 years the year round average temperature bottomed out at just 26¬∞ F the same as the average winter temperature in Chicago even today scientists are uncertain what caused the temperature to drop so quickly variations in the Earth's orbit a change in the tilt of its axis and even the creation of the Himalayan Mountain range are all prime [Music] suspects but one thing is certain with sub-zero temperatures all year round snow never melted a major storm can drop more than 40 million tons of snow the ever increasing weight compacted down into thick layers of solid ice America's Ice Age had begun an important clue to what happened next lays in a rock quarry just outside the town of Champagne Illinois in quaries like this rocks normally hidden deep underground are exposed by commercial blasting that gives geologists the chance to examine rocks they could never normally see this rock in this Sandy cobbly bank is a very important significant piece of evidence for the history of North America during the last several hundred thousand years it's what we call an erratic it's a rock that doesn't belong here now this rock traveled several hundred miles uh to get to this place in fact this is a type of granite usually found in Canada somehow it is traveled to Illinois but it's not unique all over the northern states rocks of all shapes and sizes have been dumped in places they don't belong this one the size of an elevator is in Central Park New York it was originally from New Jersey and this one the size of an automobile and weighing just as much comes from 500 M north of Ontario scientists have figured out just how such huge rocks must have been transported over such long distances the ice sheets which built up 2 million years ago began to move flowing as huge glaciers across the northern us some of the very large rocks can be literally Frozen on and plucked off from the rock where they came from and transported right into the glacier and move that distance of hundreds of miles in the glacier like a conveyor belt out to where we finally find it on the landscape or in and outc crop like this the investigator's next challenge is is finding out just how far the ice flowed and for that task they are taking to the air in the early morning light brown spots a mysterious small hill standing out from the flat Illinois plane stripped of its camouflage layer of trees the shape of the Hill tells Brown the secrets of its creation this gently rolling landscape extends for about 4 00 miles we look at the landforms and how they're shaped and so we can use that to unravel the history of of the Ice Age the land form Brown is studying is a mound of rubble that geologists call a merine it is an accumulation of debris that a glacier has plucked up from the earth dragged along and dumped at the front edge this hill marks the spot where the glacier finally stopped flowing Southward geologists all over the US have recorded the positions of other Marine Hills helping them map out precisely how far North America's ice sheets spread nearly 2/3 of the North American continent was buried under ice [Music] so far scientists studying America's Ice Age have discovered tiny temperature recording seab bugs in Ocean sediment showing the US chilled down 27¬∞ at the start of the Ice Age and morine hills of rock and debris mapping out where the ice sheets halted but the Frozen chaos did not stop there the challenge now facing geologists is figuring out how ice created some of modern North America's most famous features 2 million years ago temperatures fell and massive ice sheets spread out as glaciers across much of North America geologists set out to discover what the moving ICE did to the underlying land everywhere the ice had flowed investigators discovered the same puzzling feature lines of stones all laid out in the same particular way this is a really good example of a pavement of stones this concentration of small rocks and cobbles that are collected here in a line it's just one one stone or two stones thick scientists realize that the stone Pavements must have been laid down at the base of a glacier and even the toughest rocks had scratches and grooves carved into their surface Glacier carries along other fragments of rock and at us doing so it scratches polishes and creates grooves in the rock called striations those scratches offered vital Clues to help uncover the history of how the Ice Age changed America [Music] America we can measure their orientation and they can tell us something about the direction of Ice Flow so I'm aligning my compass parallel to the striations on this rock the compass tells me that the ice is Flowing from about the Northeast from this direction to this direction but other scratches on rocks found all over the Northern parts of the US run in puzzlingly different directions these ice scraped rocks in New York Central Park show scratches made by a glacier that arrived from the Northwest there's only one explanation for the different ways in which the ice appears to have moved the scratches were not all made by a single ice sheet as first thought but by many different ones this phenomena of advance and retreat changing of that landscape happened many times not just once but many times everywhere the ice flowed it marked the underlying rocks that's given investigators plenty of Clues to help establish a pattern of ice movements but understanding the full picture involves a lot of geological detective work this cycle of glaciation of advance and Retreat leaves an incredibly complicated record for us to to solve we only see fragments of this puzzle in any place we look at like in a quarry and so it's a great challenge for us to figure out how each of these fragments fit together the ice changed the existing conditions on the landscape those changes include erosion of glacial debris in a way that changes the whole way these areas look grinding over the landscape at speeds of around 2 ft per day the massive glaciers diverted the course of ancient Rivers even the mighty Mississippi was no match for the ice it moved the position of the Mississippi River the Mississippi River used to flow through the middle of Illinois a glacier Advanced across the state and created an ice dam across the course of the Old River a huge Lake grew at the edge of the ice eventually overs spilled and cut a new River Channel 80 Mi to the West [Music] the same course that it follows to this day and when the ice sheets melted away their impact on North America was almost as great they produced immense floods of water which all had to drain away somewhere it formed a completely new landscape with new river valleys new channels new places where rivers flow completely rearranging the character of the existing [Music] landscape where rocks were soft or weakened by faults the glaciers had carved out huge basins in the landscape when the floods came these depressions rapidly filled up with water every natural lake here in Indiana Illinois Wisconsin were all created by glaciers the biggest ice scoured basins became what we now call the Great Lakes these water-filled craters in the North American landscape are nearly 52,000 cubic miles in size the water they hold could drown the whole of New York state to a depth of more than 600 ft but even that is just a tiny fraction of the total flood un un leashed as the retreating ice poured out nearly 39,000 cubic miles of water that's over 100 times as much water as is found today in every single River on Earth the flood rushed down the Niagara escarment at the rate of 42 million gallons a minute 1 and 1/2 olympic sized swimming pools every second and that cut a Gorge 7 m long and 180 ft deep through solid rock the Ice Age had created one of the modern wonders of the world Niagra Falls the investigator's next challenge was figuring out why the ice Advanced and retreated so often it wasn't until the mid 19 60s that the first real Clues were discovered the US military was building bases in some of the Earth's most remote locations this is an ideal Arctic laboratory permanently Frozen under a polar ice cap which covers all but a few coastal areas of the island geologists realized that the cores of ice being extracted by Hollow drills held a unique historical record those cores and many others extracted since are housed in a laboratory in Denver Colorado we're in the Fort Knox of paleo climate what you see in these tubes is gold in terms of what we know about climate and what we've learned about climate over the last 50 years these tubes contain 3ft long plugs of ice each dug out from layer after layer of compacted snow but it is what is trapped inside the ice that most fascinates the scientists as each Year's snow falls onto the last it builds up in loose packed layers that trap air between the snowflakes ice cores are the only archive we have really good archive we have of past atmosphere in an ice core you can see Tiny Bubbles and those bubbles are air unadulterated air from as much as 100,000 to a million years ago the deeper the bubble the older the air it contains not only a temperature signal but it contains uh dust signals that tell us about atmospheric circulation it contains a record of the atmosphere uh and specifically the greenhouse gases each ice layer corresponds with a precise time in Earth's history when its snow first fell so by analyzing the bubbles from any one layer scientists can figure out what Earth's atmosphere was like at any point in the past imagine you're writing a book and every year you add a page to that book and that page Stacks up and stacks up and stacks up the climate scientists come along later and read that page by Page by page as we go down through an [Music] reading this Frozen record of Earth's climate has revealed that the growth and Retreat of America's ice followed a distinct pattern over the last million years or so we see fairly regular pacing of major major glaciations roughly one every 100,000 years some theories suggest those colder spells coincide with variations in Earth's orbit around around the Sun but that's not the only thing the ice cores revealed the cores that white has been studying suggest that the longer the Ice Age went on the worse it became somewhere around 400,000 years ago we went from a period that had lesser glaciations if you will to ones that were very very big so far the geology detectives have uncovered evidence of how America's ever worsening Ice Age created some of the continent's most significant features scratched rocks show how the glaciers ground their way across North America and Ice cores record a 100,000-year cycle of freeze and thaw and temperatures That Grew ever colder as the Ice Age continued but new Clues suggest that the awesome impact of America's Ice Age didn't stop there the investigation next explores how ice distorted the shape of the earth and transformed the coastal outline of the entire North American [Music] continent 2 million years ago the average annual temperature fell dramatically moving glaciers spread sheets of solid ice as far south as Illinois investigators set out to discover how thick those ice sheets were and what the weight of all that ice did to North [Music] America their first clue came in New York state on bare Mountain no one knows for sure how thick the ice sheet was that came from the northwest but right now we're standing on the top of bare Mountain about 1280 ft above sea level what we're looking at here are a series of chatter marks these are features of glacial erosion they're produced by large blocks of solid rock embedded in the base of a very thick Glacier those Boulders impinged on this Bedrock surface plucking pieces of rock off as the glacial ice moved over bare Mountain Charles magan's Mountaintop discovery shows how thick the advancing ice must have have been the glacial ice sheet could care less about this large mountain there's no question that the glacial ice sheet traveled over bare Mountain as if it weren't even there and most people think that this glacial ice sheet was about a mile thick or more the marks are clear evidence that the New York ice sheep must have towered about four times higher than the Empire State Building figures like this have enabled Aquarian to estimate the total amount of ice that buried North America it's a staggering 17 million cubic miles of ice imagine this block of ice it's uh about 6 in thick being the I sheet that covered North America during the last glaciation you need several billion of these maybe 100 billion it's it's a number almost too big to imagine this block of ice weighs 27 lb and is just half a cubic foot in size but there were 17 million cubic miles of ice covering America when scientists calculated the total weight of the ice it was an almost incomprehensibly large figure 68,000 trillion tons unsurprisingly such a vast weight of ice did not just affect America it distorted the shape of the planet I've got a beach ball here that has a depiction of the whole earth and every continent on it and right here is the outline of North America and during the Ice Age snow started to accumulate in Canada and as that ice thickened it started to flow from the centers of snow accumulation Southward into North America reaching its maximum extent right here in Illinois and when it did that this mass of ice depressed the continent Earth's solid crust sits on top of a layer that scientists call the mantle semi- Molen Rock which behaves a little like hot sticky plastic the weight of the vast plains of ice pushed down Inland areas and simultaneously made parts of the coastline bulge up from the sea but investigators have also found evidence of other ways that the ice altered the outline of America's coasts the borders with the sea that Define the continent we see [Music] today a vital clue came in downtown Miami in the unlikely setting of a munici ipal Courthouse we're here in front of this impressive building uh built in the early 1900s because of the materials used to face its surface these stones are constructed of fossilized coral reefs and if you know what you're looking at it can actually tell you quite a bit about Florida's past and maybe its future the coral stone is made from the hard calcium carbonate skeletons of tiny sea creatures animals that only grow in very shallow water but this Courthouse Stone was quarried out of an ancient coral reef that Now lies a mile from the present day ocean and way above sea level I'm standing here about 5 or 6 feet above sea level and walking alongside this rock face which is about 6t tall the interesting thing about this rock face is it's actually composed of fossilized corals and the fact that we're standing here today amongst these fossil corals tells us that in the past we would have been under 10 or 15 ft of water right now the coral stones have been dated to around 130,000 years ago which means the sea level around Miami must then have been far higher than today as experts tried to figure out why why the sea level was so high then new evidence emerged about Florida's coral reefs and the Mystery deepened even further divers off the coast of Miami found a coral reef now submerged 450 ft under the water these corals grew just 25,000 years ago and because a reef like this only forms in shallow water the scientists realized that the sea level back then must have been far lower than it is today and that means the coastline would have been in a completely different location right now we're about 2 mil offshore of fort laudale on the edge of the Gulf Stream but 20 25,000 years ago at the time of sea level low stand we would be sitting right next to a beach here we'd be looking where we see today the ocean and the highrises in the back we'd be looking toward a sandy beach in front of a gently rolling Hillside investigators studying the coral records figured out that the up and down sea levels would repeatedly have altered the entire shape of America if you look at the outline of North America the outline that I learned to draw in elementary school if we were living years ago I would draw Florida differently 25,000 years ago when sea levels were low Florida was Triple the size it is today because more land was out of the water geologists realized that the changes in sea level around the coast were directly related to the different levels of ice on land that Discovery was the key to understanding what the Ice Age had done water evaporated from the oceans and condensed in the atmosphere to form snow but in the colder times that snow built up as ice sheets on the land and with so much of the world's total water supply locked up as ice the oceans simply ran short of water and the sea levels fell when the earth is cold there's more ice on the land and sea level is lower because of that when the earth is warm there's less ice on the land and sea levels higher and that makes sense because when that ice when it melts off the land it's got to go in the ocean the story of how ice sculpted modern North America is drawing closer to the present day chatter marks in Upstate New York reveal that ice sheets grew a mile or more thick and ancient reefs off the coast of Florida proved that water levels in the ocean changed again and again ice had shaped the continent now scientists discovered that it had also uncovered a bridge to other lands and shaped the future of [Music] mankind North America's Ice Age began 2 million years ago as the Earth moved around the Sun America's temperatures fluctuated 130,000 years ago it enjoyed a warm tropical climate then 25,000 years ago it grew colder than ever glaciers covered 2/3 of North America with ice up to a mile deep now the investigation examines how these freezing temperatures altered the course of human history in North America at Paisley caves in Oregon scientists are unearthing vital clues that humans Left Behind here's your coite it's a beautiful specimen the evidence is copperlite fossilized human excrement this site is the location of the find of the oldest human remains that have been directly dated here in the United States with DNA in them that indicates uh people from uh probably Siberia came here at least 14,300 years ago today North America is separated from Siberia by open water but the presence of men from Siberia on American soil is compelling evidence that around 14,000 years ago a land bridge must have linked the two continents geologists know that the amount of water locked up as ice on land meant that there was less water in the oceans more importantly for the future of the US the retreating Pacific and Arctic oceans left the seabed between America and Siberia high and dry but a doubt Still Remains The Men Who Lived in Paisley caves 14,000 years ago could conceivably have reached America by [Music] sea but that theory is diminished by the discovery of this artifact this is a tool that has been carved out of a bone belonging to a camelops more commonly called the Western [Music] camel you can see the curvature of the bone here this is the outside of the bone it would have continued on uh in quite a large Arch uh all the way around uh what they have done is to saw this piece out and then they have saw in teeth right here running all the way across the animal that died here was the ancient an ancestor to the two humped camel now found in Asia few people know it evolved in the US camels have been here for about 40 million years so what has been surprising to me is the fact that people didn't know that camels were here in fact the earliest camel fossils ever found were discovered in South Dakota and predate finds elsewhere in the world by millions of years [Music] the finds are clear evidence that camels evolved in America and once lived nowhere else on the planet so camels which couldn't have migrated by sea could only have crossed into Asia via a land bridge but a mystery remains fossil records show that camels disappeared from North America 12,000 years ago though scientists want to know why there is no doubt at the end of the last ice age we saw a substantial reduction in the number of species here in the Western Hemisphere so what causes those things uh it's possible that weather changed so dramatically so quickly that they could not adapt back in Denver in the ice core lab Jim white is examining the piece of evidence which could confirm that the Ice Age killed off the camels this is a really fascinating piece of ice and one of the most important pieces of ice that we have in the collection this is the the aha moment of climate change the evidence is an ice core a frozen Time Capsule recording the temperature of North America 12,000 years ago it showed that the US suddenly got even colder we've opened our book of climate and if we read the book from today going back in time that's page 12,000 and imagine if you will from this moment back in time we had a thousand years of cold it's evidence of the last gasp of the Ice Age another rapid freezing of America these abrupt climate changes can be a 10¬∞ celsus change in temperature in 50 years or less uh temperature changes of a degree celsius per year sustained over several years that is a 16¬∞ fah fall in temperature you're looking at going from a Miami to Montreal kind of change in climate The Big Chill occurred quickly from mild to freezing cold in less than a century but it lasted nearly 1,600 years it was a deep freeze so great that it proved too much for North America's camels mammoths and other large animals we're on a roller coaster of climate change that must have been extremely stressful for the uh plants and animals that were living during that time this final deadly Big Chill of the Ice Age ended 10,000 years ago it was the last last time ice Advanced across the continent scientists investigating the legacy of the advance of America's ice sheets have discovered copper light strong evidence that glaciers caused the sea level to drop exposing a land bridge that linked Siberia to North America and this ice core which records the final deadly deep freeze of the Ice Age next scientists investigate how the end of The Big Chill marks the beginning of the warm period America enjoys today and how that may spell disaster for some of her greatest cities deep freezes over 2 million years have seen giant ice sheets rampaging across North America that ice crushed scarred and flooded the land to create some of America's most recognizable geological features the Great Lakes the mighty Mississippi and Niagara Falls were all created by the action of advancing and then retreating ice for the last 10,000 years the earth has experienced warmer and warmer temperatures and the passing of its ice has impacted the North American continent in other equally significant ways the ice changed the existing conditions on the landscape it's changed the way we live in this environment we get our drinking water from these materials our Rich agricultural soils are a part of that Legacy the most productive Farmland in the world is right here in North America from an economic standpoint alone the billions of dollars worth of productivity of Agriculture are a direct result of the ice age during its Ice Age vast areas of North America were covered by glaciers today they cover just 29,000 square miles America's dwindling ice is a precious resource each summer in Washington state alone melting glaciers provide 470 billion gallons of drinking water but it comes at a price the melting ice has pushed up sea levels by a foot each century and that rate is increasing and the scientists who study life in the oceans are seeing firsthand the impact it is having the coral animal itself builds a city very much like we humans do the coral had to move as sea level changed as sea level went down it had to follow that sea level down that sea level came up it had to follow that sea level up the question we have to ask ourselves as humans as sea level changes will our cities have to adapt just like the coral reef currently about 10% of the world's total land surface approximately 6 million square mil is covered by ice [Music] sheets but this ice is melting fast if present warming Trends continue all the glaciers in Montana's Glacier National Park will be gone by 2030 today North America's longest glacier is the bearing Glacier in Alaska it is 130 Mi long and 10 Mi wide with solid ice up to half a mile deep but over the past 20 years that ice has become thinner as much as 600 feet thinner at the point where the glacier reaches the sea so much ice is Now Melting that every year it pours out at least 7 cubic miles of flood water twice as much water as there is in the entire length of the Colorado River over the same time Arctic sea ice has shrunk by 250 million Acres an area the size of Texas and New Mexico [Music] combined if Earth's ice continues to melt at this rate it will once again redraw the map of America's coastline this is what Florida looked like in 1995 here is what it could look like in 100 years a loss of more than 4 million Acres where 1 and2 million people lived in 2010 and at the ocean's present rate of rise this is the coast of Florida as it might look at the end of The Next Century in the year 2200 this is Miami or what's left of it by then the city's Ocean Drive might be a drive under the ocean a return to the Sea levels of 130,000 years ago the geologists investigating America's Ice Age have found evidence that the power of ice has been crucial in helping to create modern North America bugs in Sea mud acted as Tiny thermometers recording the start of America's Ice Age morine Hills proved that moving glaciers flowed far enough to cover 2/3 of the continent Under Ice crescent-shaped marks on a Mountaintop in Upstate New York showed that the ice sheets grew to be more than a mile thick and ancient coral reefs were evidence that sea levels repeatedly changed throughout America's 2 milliony yearlong Ice Age the investigation has uncovered the full picture of how I sculpted the geology of the US but that process is not yet finished as North America's ice melts back it uncovers a landscape that's been buried for thousands sometimes millions of years living proof that the Earth is never ever at rest Earth a unique Planet restless and dynamic continents shift and Clash volcanoes erupt glaciers grow and recede Titanic forces that are constantly at work leaving a trail of GE iCal Mysteries behind and there is nowhere more mysterious than Death Valley the hottest and driest desert in the United States this is a place where even 700 lb rocks appear to move by themselves it's the lowest point in the US and right here the Earth's crust is thinner than almost anywhere else on the planet Death Valley is a dynamic laboratory for investigators who uniquely read rocks like x-rays to reveal the inner workings of the earth and its history adding to the Continuing Story of how the Earth was made death Val is the largest national park in the lower 48 states more than three times the size of Rhode Island straddling the border of California and Nevada and surrounded by towering mountain peaks 140 Mi long and up to 15 M wide with temperatures reaching a scorching 134¬∞ F this is one of the most inhospitable places on Earth [Music] Earth but for geologists Death Valley has a unique attraction here they can witness the interplay of the Earth's most Titanic geological forces when you look at Death Valley really you're looking at a battle a battle between processes that are occurring on the Earth's surface and we can see the record of those forces of nature locked been to the Rocks Death Valley has an archive that is almost unrivaled worldwide to uncover death Valley's earliest history prave is hunting for its oldest rocks he is searching in one of its most remote spots in the extreme South of the valley in the isolated Alexander Hills this is one of the oldest rocks in death valy it's 1.2 billion years old and give it the color of this rock and the fact that it's quite soft it can powder when I scratch it these are all clues that tell me that this is a limestone the limestone is a major clue to revealing the way this arid desert used to look if we think about the type of environments that limestones can be deposited in the first that comes to mind is an underwater in a marine setting there is only one way to form Limestone it is made from the tiny bones and shells of sea creatures they die and sink to the sea floor where the weight of further layers on top of them crushes them slowly into Solid [Music] Rock and prave has discovered other startling evidence that Death Valley had a watery past fossils are a major clue they are vital in the type of evidence that a geologist will use and these are some very nice examples of the type of fossils that you can find in these ancient rocks and you can see here these curving surfaces outlining what look to be large cabbages that are sliced in half these were algae known as a stromatolite ironically these Marine fossils have survived in the Death Valley desert only because there is so little water that might other wise have washed them away but they would have originally looked like this when they flourished in the Death Valley Waters as the limestone formed more than 1 billion years ago these tell us that the environment when this rock formed would have been a shallow sea if I'd been here when these rocks were first being formed I'd be sitting in my swimming trunks about waste Deep in water very much like the Bahamas today the stromatal ltes are some of the earliest signs of Life on our planet to discover what happened over the next 1 billion years prave studies evidence in the surrounding Hills the different bands of colors and The Rock layers and the hills represent ancient seas that covered the Death Valley area the Seas would deposit a layer of limestone move back across the land another layer of limestone would be deposited and so we have a history of the Seas moving across the Death Valley region from the time of the stromatolites to these Rock layers now more than a million years later geologists wanted to figure out what dramatic geological upheaval could have turned Death Valley from a shallow sea to the baking hot desert of today and prave has found clues in a rock that is entirely different from the Marine limestones he has studied up until now this is a nice example of a rock type called a granite and it forms those veins that are in the hillside behind me you can think of these like the fingers of my hand they're fed upward from a much more larger massive area of granite sitting underneath the granite tells scientists the reasons why death Valley's ancient Seas vanished today it is solid rock but it was once hot molten magma from deep underground only one force of Nature has the awesome power and 2,000 de F heat to melt rock into magma and fire it to the surface volcanoes the Seas here didn't just drain away they were pushed back by these mountains of fire it was only in the 1960s with the realization that Earth's continents were drifting around the planet that scientists figured out why the volcanoes erupted under Death Valley the theory of plate tectonics revealed that around 100 million years ago an ancient oceanic plate began sinking under North America pushing up the land heat from the Collision powered a coastal chain of volcanoes erupting on the land and finally driving away the Seas submerging Death Valley this landscape would have been very explosive a hostile type of setting and that then set the stage for what was to become Death Valley still surviving in the valley to this today is the ghost town evidence of another substance far rarer than granite that the volcanoes brought to the surface gold although gold occurs naturally in more than 30 different US states the golden Death Valley was concentrated in veins in the rock as magma solidified near the surface it made it worth Mining and millions of years after its formation it sparked the Death Valley Gold Rush It's a Wonderful example of a gold mine shaft it's the eure mine high up in the Panamint mountains associated with trying to find gold in the granites that were intruded into these rocks 100 to 200 million years ago the gold would have been in veins these fingers would have been injected up into these rocks and the gold would have been concentrated in these veins the gold brush here lasted just a few years miners often had to remove a ton of rock to recover only one/ tenth of an ounce of gold enough to produce just a single wedding [Music] ring today All That Remains are empty tunnels and ghost [Music] towns it's interesting to consider that the frenzy of activity min gold was actually a direct result of the kind of volcanic activity 100 to 200 million years ago geologists investigating the battle that raged in Death Valley between fiery volcanoes and ancient Seas have found important evidence stromatolite fossils are proof that Death Valley was once submerged By the Waters of a shallow sea veins of granite could only have formed in the fiery heat of the volcanoes that burst to the surface around 100 million years ago and drove that sea away the volcanoes built up the land that was to become Death Valley into Peaks as high as the cascade's mountain range but deep beneath the earth's surface awesome geological forces were about to destroy those Peaks stretch the land apart and transform the mountains of Death Valley into the lowest point in the [Music] US for a billion years Death Valley remained a flat plane Under the Sea around 100 million years ago erupting volcanoes formed high mountain ranges but then the real geological mystery began the land here must have undergone an extraordinary transformation because today in Death Valley those high mountain ranges have vanished incredibly the onetime mountains have sunk below sea level to become the lowest point in North America yet all around the valley snowcapped Peaks still soar up to 11,000 ft into the air the investigation digs deep under the landscape to discover what vast geological forces could have caused that huge difference in height between two places just 20 M away from each other there are a lot of mysterious aspects about Death Valley it's a unique landscape because the valley floor itself is is very deep it's below sea level and the mountains rise up very steeply on either either side Clues to the power of these underground forces lie all over the valley if you know know where to look many of the rock layers were originally deposited on the ancient flat seabed they can still be seen as horizontal layers but other nearby layers aren't horizontal at all they tilt downwards into the ground Miller finds a further clue of Earth's power in the unusual shape of this cinder cone a mound of Ash and debris lying on death Valley's floor it looks like it's two Cinder cones but in fact it's really just one that's been pulled apart along a big fault [Music] Zone this has moved some 700 ft in some 700,000 years so that's about a foot per thousand years which sounds like it's really really slow but if you look at it over a great length of geologic time you get quite a lot of slip and give it even longer time it'll be offset even [Music] more Miller's next challenge is explaining what is making the fault line move for that she studies other ancient rock formations whose Jagged outline has given them the name turtlebacks the turtlebacks are crucial to understanding death Valley's early Origins they have so much of the record here if you're willing to spend time to try to unravel it the real clue lies in The Rock's distinctive texture if you just take a look at this rock closely you can see that it's very kind of strung out very stringy it tends to be uh pretty fine grained this texture tells Miller where these rocks came from we see evidence that if these rocks were deformed just like if you take a piece of plastic and re heat it up you could bend it it's the same thing with Rock and so these rocks formed at high temperatures and pressures within the Earth's crust a depths of about 10 Mi or so and they have since been brought to the Earth's surface Miller concluded that some overwhelming underground force must have raised the turtleback rocks to the surface and stretched them out like warm toffee as Death Valley formed the final explanation of what happened here once again came back to the way continents drift around the globe as the Collision of the plates that had forced ancient volcanoes to the surface slowed down and ceased the high mountains that once dominated the land were slowly pulled apart and tilted downwards gradually as the underlying crust grew thinner and thinner a deep Basin formed between the mountain ranges Death Valley is the most extreme example of what such stretching forces can do by measuring seismic waves scientists discovered that here the continental crust is just 16 Mi thick this might sound like a lot but it is far thinner than almost anywhere else on the planet around the globe GL the Earth's continental crust averages 25 Mi thick it's strongest beneath the Himalayas at 43 Mi thick enough to support the weight of massive mountains such as [Music] Everest the turtleback Rocks also offer Miller evidence as to when death Valley's stretching started dating these rocks reveals that the deformation started here around 13 million years ago although Death Valley did not take on its final shape immediately Death Valley is really young um when you look at the whole geologic time scale modern Death Valley is probably 3 or 4 million years old at the most the stretching started before that but Death Valley itself is a very recent feature scientists know that the process is far from finished they've found irrefutable evidence in the alien Death Valley Landscape known as badwater Basin I'm standing here at badwater which is the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere it's 282 ft below sea level we're actually standing below sea level about the depth of a football field this floor has been sinking it's about a tenth of an inch per year which is about half of the speed at which your fingernail [Music] grows continual stretching of the Earth's crust has turned bad water into one of the lowest spots on any continent on the planet yet its true depth is even lower still the surface that we see here is the present day surface but what one has to realize is that beneath our feet we can go down through sediment that represents ancient periods of time when Death Valley was a surface that goes down 3 miles you would need to drill down through the sediment to a depth equivalent to 11 empire state buildings end to end before you hit the crustal Bedrock the total volume of material in this Basin would bury New York to the depth of nearly a mile the valley floor is constantly being covered with sediment cascading from the surrounding mountains but it can never fill up completely the sediment is coming in at a rate that is less than the rate of sinking of Death Valley itself so that we're always maintaining a surface here on the valley that is sitting below sea level and is continuing to sink through time this constant movement shows Earth's geological forces at their most dynamic and makes Death Valley unique the Allure is that nowhere on Earth do we see continental crust being pulled apart at this rate or this magnitude the investigation into death Valley's creation has established how it sank to become the lowest point in North America the turtleback Rocks were deformed by the powerful tectonic forces pulling the mountains of part to form a wide valley floor the still sinking landscape of bad water currently 282 ft below sea level is proof that the crust here is still being stretched today but the sinking of Death Valley is just one part of the story geologists still need to investigate how one of the hottest places on Earth was shaped by the power of moving [Music] ICE 1.2 billion years ago Death Valley was submerged by ancient seas around a billion years later volcanic mountains drove the Seas away 13 million years ago the continental crust started stretching apart here and by 3 million years ago Death Valley was one of the lowest points on Earth the clue that showed investigators what happened next was the discovery in the valley of a little known but highly valued White crystallin Rock when one thinks of Prospectors in the Death Valley region one often thinks of them hunting for gold and for silver but there was one mineral that was much less glamorous much less sexy and exciting and that was borax but it was was actually known as the white gold of the desert in 1880 borax was a rare but in demand mineral used in antiseptics and detergents one impoverished couple desperately trying to make a living in Death Valley was Aaron and Rosie Winters they heard from a passing prospector that they could make good money from borax if they could find it they learned from their fellow prospector the then secret method of testing Rock for borax anxious to keep potential profits for themselves the couple waited until the dead of night to perform the test in Death Valley you burn the mineral to see if the powder that we have in front of us here contains any borax now what the winters did is to add sulfuric acid to borax bearing mineral We'll add some alcohol the winters probably used cheap whiskey back in 1880 and the flame should burn hopefully a green color if borax is there and as we can see the flame is green in color and in 1880 the winters knew that they would become wealthy cuz they had borax from these humble beginnings a whole industry grew in Death Valley it made the Winter's fortune and also gave scientists A Priceless clue in their quest to understand the geological history of Death Valley because borax deposits like these can only be found in the beds of ancient freshwater lakes the seawater that once covered this Valley had long gone a billion or more years earlier but the presence of borax proves that fresh water must have flooded into the area when Ice Age glaciers started to melt from the surrounding mountains around 200,000 years ago as the glaciers melted Rivers flowed towards the lowest point Death Valley gradually a vast Lake spread out across the flooded valley floor the Valley's catchment area was huge its rivers drained more than 9,000 square miles an area bigger than New Hampshire the water pouring in from the surrounding mountains leeched minerals such as borax from the rocks and deposited them on the lake bed in a lot of the lake beds this mineral borax would appear as kind of a white fuzzy mineral it was actually called cotton ball The Borax proved that a lake existed here geologists called it Lake Manley after one of the Pioneers William L Manley who had named Death Valley in 1849 but they had no evidence to tell them its depth and its [Music] size a solution to this puzzle is revealed in this small hill with a road cut straight through it near the Valley's Edge at a spot called Bey Junction it's very fortunate to have a road cut right through this gravel deposit so in the exposure we can see very well-rounded Pebbles we can also see some crude layering in the gravels and they're stacked in against each other and we call that shingling the shape and the smoothness of the stones tells Casi exactly how these Pebbles got here the way their stack tells us that the direction of water flow that laid these Pebbles down like like this was from the right to the left so we know that this had to be wave action that's strong evidence that this is a beach environment by looking at the height of this Pebble Beach above the valley floor Casi calculates the dimensions of the lake from this beach Gravel Bar that we're standing on um the waves would have been crashing at our feet and as we look South it's hard to imagine a lake sitting out there across that vast salt pan but Lake Manley would have covered about 600 square miles and it would have been about 450 ft [Music] deep it's odd mapping shorelines on a really hot day in Death Valley you kind of long for the the ancient days of your when there were big lakes out here you imagine this was a beautiful place full of lush vegetation yeah it was quite a different place than it is today for Casi the next step is discovering why Death Valley no longer has a lake and there is evidence about that in one of its most unusual Landscapes this Twisted Jagged field of white Peaks that's called The Devil's Golf Course even the Sounds here are mysterious in the Silence of the desert there is a faint popping noise as the Relentless Sun sucks every drop of moisture out of the parched surface the salt that we see here is the remains of an ancient Lake it's called Devil's golf course because it's probably the least likely surface that you would ever want to play golf on the surface is made up of rough salt crystals popping when they expand and contract in the Searing heat but this salt did not come from the sea just like the borax the salt was leeched from The Rock when fresh water started flowing into Death Valley 200,000 years ago the salt was originally dissolved in the freshwater lake Manley and casy has a simple experiment to show exactly how it ended up on the floor of Death Valley I'll pour the water and salt solution into this pan and as the water evaporates we should see salt forming and that's exactly how that this um salt crust forms so it's hot enough out here today it should evaporate pretty [Music] quickly in Fairly short amount of time some beautiful salt crystals formed along the edges but that's essentially how a salt pan forms when the rain water comes in the salt goes into solution uh basically just like the water that we have in this water bottle and from the moment the water starts evaporating salt crystals start forming today Death Valley salt pans cover more than 200 square miles an area three times the size of Washington DC they are the remnants of the ancient Lake that finally disappeared 2,000 years ago when earth's climate began to warm up from then onwards death Valley's temperatures just kept on Rising in Death Valley is definitely one of the hottest spots in the world the record high was 134 degrees Fahrenheit recorded back in July 10th 1913 and just to give you perspective on that the caretaker of the Furnace Creek Ranch who actually was the one doing the recordings back then he describes that day as being so hot he saw the swallows falling dead in Flight geologists today under understand how death Valley's unusual geology is responsible for the punishing climate that killed off its Lake it stays so dry because there are three distinct mountain ranges between Death Valley and the moisture carried off of the Pacific Ocean over 200 miles away where we have the Sierra Nevada to the west of us the storms come in from the West Laden with moisture as they rise up they lose most of that moisture on the west side and each set of mountain Wicks a little more moisture out of the clouds and here with our three sets of mountains in between us and the ocean by the time that moisture to gets to Death Valley there's either all gone or we just get a few drops of rain almost all storms from the coast are stopped by the three mountain ranges each one in turn having an effect the scientists call a rain shadow so we are in the rain shadow of a rain shadow of a rain shadow and average less than 2 in a year and there is another way that geology influences the desert climate air heated under the cloudless sky is trapped by the surrounding mountains in summer Death Valley becomes a deadly dangerous [Music] furnace the local weather station provides a graphic demonstration of how quickly that heat could have destroyed death Valley's Lake every day caligan checks the rate of evaporation the summer months it may take five of these containers here so I'm going to fill them up and dump them into the pond until it brings the water level up to the needle now our average rainfall is barely 2 Ines a year but the evaporation Pond records up to 150 in of evaporation that huge discrepancy between the amount of rainfall and the speed of evaporation means that a lake 12 ft deep and 30 Mi long would evaporate in just a single year Lake Manley was bigger than that but over time it never stood a [Music] chance the scientist studies of Death Valley have solved the mysteries of its freshwater past borax discovered here in the 1880s proves that Death Valley was once filled with a freshwater lake Pebbles Unearthed on an ancient Shoreline show the lake once covered 600 square miles an area three times the size of Chicago when the last freshwater pools dried up here 2,000 years ago Death Valley started its rign as the driest place in the US which makes it ironic that the investigation's next phase examining the Valley's most recent geological upheavals involv scientists studying the awesome power of fastf flowing water around 100 million years ago death Valley's ancient Seas gave way to exploding volcanoes whose Peaks were then wrenched apart to create the lowest spot in America from around 200,000 years ago the valley filled with a freshwater lake but the rain shadow of surrounding mountains dried up the water for the past 2,000 years Death Valley has been hotter and drier than anywhere else in North America which makes it all the more mysterious to find Mosaic Canyon a deep Chasm seemingly cut by water in this parched and arid land especially when there is evidence of massive Boulders having been pushed around like pebbles just look at the size of that Boulder and look at how high above my feet it is it's about 3 ft in diameter and I can't even estimate what the weight of that thing is she may be in a desert but mesina knows there is only one force that could have lifted the boulder up so high water brought it here and left it here the force of the water that came through here had to have been pretty severe in order to get that boulder up there plastered against the wall this Boulder gives us evidence about the force of the water that comes down these Canyons during flash floods a flash flood is one of Nature's most lethal weapons if there were a flash flood coming down this Canyon I wouldn't have enough time to run out of its path because the water flows down at an incredible velocity flash floods are among the most violent processes on the earth they can carry material the size of an SUV without any problem at all in one of the driest places in the world the flood water comes from a surprising Source rain [Music] on average Death Valley receives just 2 in of rain a year this is less than half the rain that falls on New York in a single month but violent summer storms mean it can all fall in just a single day the floods transform the desert landscape in a number of ways one is known as the desert Bloom where seeds and plants that may have Lain dormant for up to 10 years burst into flower after a sudden rainfall this phenomenon might be beautiful but there is another deadlier side to these floods with a human cost in 2004 there was a flash flood that came down Furnace Creek it was just this muddy slurry that was dense enough to pick up a vehicle and carry it downhill and several people died in it the 2004 flash flood is small in comparison to some of the events that we see preserved here in the Rocks flash floods happen all over the world but there's evidence here of their particular and rare geological effect in Death Valley this marble is very highly polished it's not scratched it's not gouged it's been Polished by very very fine grain material it comes down as part of a flash flood so it's really smooth and it's fluted it's really unique to uncover how these unusual polished walls were formed mesina takes a closer look at what geologists term the bad lands I think it's called bad because nothing will grow on it there's just this very loose material out here and it erodes so readily that plants can even take root so this is bad land the rock that makes up the bad lands is the dried up remains of the 2,000-year-old lake bed that once submerged Death Valley this is nothing more than desiccated mud it's called mudstone because it's slightly lithified meaning it's turned into rock the mudstone minerals are arranged in tightly packed flat sheets the rain can't penetrate the mudstone and therefore the rain picks up a lot of particles and carries them downhill these particles are the key to the Canyon's smooth polished walls it flows through here so Laden with sediment that it causes a lot of polishing and incision so every time a flash flood comes through this Canyon gets deeper the walls get higher and The Rock gets more polished the sediment Laden floods can carve into death Valley's rocks with tremendous speed and force these Canyons have been gouged out where the Rocks here have been fractured and weakened by The Continuous stretching the valley is undergoing this is upfront iny face geology happening right here Death Valley is dynamic this is a place where things are happening in a human lifespan in this arid desert the investigation has identified water as the latest factor in death Valley's continuing geological Evolution the giant Boulders plastered high on the canyon walls illustrate the power of flash flooding in the desert the smooth walls of Mosaic Canyon show how the dried mud from an ancient Lake still affects how Death Valley is being shaped to this day and yet some Mysteries remain unsolved including one of the world's most intriguing geological riddles the rocks that seem to walk by themselves moving thousands of feet across the floor of Death Valley over 1.2 billion years Death Valley has been transformed from a watery land landscape to a Barren desert but even though geologists Now understand the processes that have shaped this extraordinary region there are still Mysteries to be [Music] solved and there is no part of Death Valley more mysterious than an area known as the [Music] racetrack this parched cracked Lake Basin just 2 and 1/2 mil long and a mile wide is the setting for one of death Valley's most intriguing geological puzzles it's sliding Stones I love this place cuz it's odd I could come here a hundred more times and every time there'll be something different something I didn't see stretching Behind these rocks are long grooved trails in the earth it is clear that they are tracks left behind as the rocks move across the valley floor the puzzle is to work out how the rocks can slide uphill against this slightly tilted surface these are no mere Pebbles some of these rocks are over 700 lb and some of the trails are nearly 3,000 ft long the phenomenon was first recorded here by scientists some 100 years ago and yet in this remote location no one has ever seen the Rocks moving MSA has been tracking the movement of each individual Rock on the racetrack since 1996 her GPS readings are accurate to within a single inch geology is really nothing more than um detective work and rather than looking for evidence of things that took place a long time ago what I really like about working on the racetrack is you looking at things that are happening right now it's an ongoing process her first clue is the surface on which the Rocks slide if I try to move my hand over it I could probably file my nails right now however after it rains there's so much clay in the lake bed sediments that it gets slick it's almost like Teflon you wouldn't need very much force to set even a very large rock into motion just because the friction on the surface is almost nil but water alone isn't enough to make these rocks move MSA has identified a second Factor at work you can have rain but if you don't have wind a couple of days later I don't think these rocks are going anywhere the racetrack is a natural wind tunnel the wind funnels into the valley from the south close to the ground the winds can exceed hurricane strength reaching speeds of over 90 mph enough to push the Rocks into action if you have wind and there is no friction all you'd need to do is hit a rock with your finger like that and it would go into motion when all these elements are in place the rocks can begin their mysterious Journey since no one has ever seen the rocks in motion we can only guess how fast they go but based on some of the evidence that I've seen these rocks aren't inching Along by any means and the best estimate we have is about 3 to 4 mil an hour so a nice brisk walk but until this phenomenon is witnessed the mystery of death Valley's sliding rocks will remain main I hope that this mystery isn't solved it's what keeps me interested and I think it's what keeps a lot of people [Music] interested geologists studying Death Valley have figured out its extraordinary geological Evolution stromatal fossils show that this area was once covered by seeds turtleback rocks prove that the land was stretched apart by tectonic forces dropping the valley floor down to the lowest point in America pebbles at Bey Junction prove that Death Valley was once covered with a freshwater [Music] lake and the smooth polished walls of Mosaic Canyon show that water is still at the heart of death Valley's modern Evolution Death Valley remains one of the most extreme geological Wonders on Earth and it's still evolving its valley floor is being constantly pushed apart by forces deep within the Earth this means that the crust here will continue to stretch and thin one day tens of millions of years into the future Death Valley could be separated by the sea from the rest of the US today Death Valley continues to sink at a steady rate of 1/10th of an inch a year while its surface continues to be sculpted by water living proof that the Earth is never at [Music] rest Earth a unique Planet restless and dynamic continents shift and Clash volcanoes erupt glaciers grow and re Pro seed Titanic forces that are constantly at work leaving a trail of geological Mysteries behind this episode explores The Incredible Journey of one of the most indestructible and valuable metals on the planet gold created in outer space an immense explosion blasted minute particles of gold at 70 million mph into the rocks that form our planet how tiny pieces of scattered gold accumulate to form massive deposits is one of Earth's great Mysteries to find the answer geological detectives sift through ancient riverbeds hunting for Hidden Treasures above and below ground and investigating alien natural wonders finding clues that will ultimately reveal how the Earth was made [Music] gold has mesmerized man for thousands of years the oldest known precious metal it plays a powerful role in almost every culture on Earth since humans have been on this planet gold has been prized it is such a unique mineral it is beautiful you can take an ounce of gold and stretch it in a thin string and it'll go for 35 miles but the key to Gold's enduring value is its inactivity it won't bind with anything else except itself gold doesn't get used up it gets recycled the ring you're wearing may be the exact same gold that was in some of the gold that pharaohs wore centuries ago with all these properties it's no wonder gold has been treasured by man down through history man has mined gold for thousands of years but found only 160,000 tons worldwide enough to fit comfortably inside a four-bed house physicists discovered that this ultimate metal was created in outer space long before planet earth existed over 5 billion years ago gold and other heavy metal atoms formed in the Maelstrom of a supernova a giant dying Star as it exploded shock waves blasted minute gold particles Across the Universe at 70 million mph scattering them far and wide throughout the early solar system as this cloud of rubble compacted together the gold became trapped inside the rocks of the newly forming planet Earth widely dispersed and inactive to this day most of the Earth's gold remains as Tiny isolated particles in the Rocks it's ironic but gold is around us everywhere it's in the soil in our backyards it's in these rocks here in the riverbeds but the problem is it's in very small amounts in these rocks the gold may be at one part per billion that's like finding just a grain sand in an Olympic siiz swimming pool unusually large stashes of gold are concentrated in a handful of very special places around the world the largest in Southern Australia China South Africa Peru and the western United States it is the geologist job to find out where and why why the Earth accumulates gold in large enough quantities to mine the first pioneers of gold geology were not scientists but gold hungry Prospectors who scrutinized the Rocks their story began over 150 years ago by accident in 1848 in the small Californian town of cola along the American River James Marshall was digging a trench for a water wheel to power his lumber mill when he made an extraordinary Discovery he was digging it down during the day and then using water at night to flush out the sand and gravel and he looked and there on the Bedrock were a couple of gold nuggets rumors of California's River Gold spread like wildfire by 1849 over 90,000 people from around the world descended on the state nicknamed the 49ers these early investigators searched the streams in a bid to find their Fortune their first challenge was to figure out where gold accumulates in the river and they quickly discovered that gold wasn't just strewn anywhere along its course a clue to where the gold would be concentrated is black sand in areas like this you take a sample and pan it out the 49ers soon learned if they found heavy black sand in their pan they were on to a winner the process of panning is a simple one you're really trying to separate light materials from heavy materials in this sluggish water the heavy particles sink to the bottom of the pan and you repeat the process of washing away light materials and then concentrating the Heavies on the bottom until you get down to just the black sand and hopefully some nice gold even a small nugget like that in the same way rivers and streams separate the heavy particles from the light the gold and black sand are flush Downstream but as they hit the sluggish water on the inner bends they drop out of the [Music] flow and it's here in the sand banks on the inside bends of the river that the 49ers discovered an absolute fortune in total over 20 million ounces of river gold were discovered in the waterways of California but when they investigated the valley sides above the river the 49ers discovered an even bigger stash of gold and they wondered what was the deal with these gold deposits that were up and away from the w they took a close look at them and they could see that these Boulders were round and smooth these rounded Boulders are identical to those found in the rivers nearby and the reason is because it's an ancient riverbed it's been left high and dry by the flow of the river the River cuts downward and leaves these deposits behind the miners continued to explore and they found some just above the river like this but they found others tens and even hundreds even a thousand ft above the modern stream using powerful water jets the 49ers blasted and flushed out a further 50 million ounces of ancient river gold from California's Hills which still bear the scars over 150 years later similar river gold deposits have formed all over the world including the greatest Treasure Trove ever found wiwat Rand in South Africa its Discovery in 1886 caused another massive gold rush but this River Gold is not found on the surface miners must descend over 2 miles down the deepest mine shaft on Earth [Music] half the gold on this planet has been produced from that one group of deposits most geologists believe that these unique deposits formed from ancient river systems concentrating these in Old River gravels over millions of years thousands of ancient Rivers carrying gold spilled into a huge Lake dumping a massive gold deposit this ancient lake bed is now buried miles under underground to date wiwat Rand has produced over 1.4 billion ounces of gold worth over 1.5 trillion dollar and geologists believe the same value of gold Still Remains untouched in the search for California's River Gold 49ers found heavy black sand a sign that gold is deposited on the inside Bend of a river and gold buried beneath rounded Boulders in the valley walls proof that Rivers have been depositing gold for millions of years the 49ers suspected that Rivers were carrying gold down from a source somewhere in the mountain the motherload but the quest to understand where this motherload gold originated would take geologists deep inside the earth and face to face with some of the most destructive powers on the planet [Music] in the 19th century the 49ers plucked 70 million ounces of river gold from California's streams and ancient riverbeds valued at more than $80 billion but this easy gold didn't last the race was on to find the source of the river gold the motherload and they set off into the mountains to investigate and this is what the old-timers were really looking for a big wide vein of quartz filled with gold it runs literally for Miles through the countryside they were able to mine millions of ounces of gold from sources just like this with the discovery of motherload gold prospecting changed from a solo quest to Big Business hundreds of Mines sprung up all over California employing thousands of men discovering what geological Force had concentrated gold in California's mountains was a puzzle that would bamboozle scientists for decades in 1853 the alagan mine opened in Sierra County California today it's over 3,300 ft deep with over 40 mil of tunnels all leading to one special slice of rock in the mountain here I am in the middle of the motherload vein it must be about 40 ft thick and It Go goes down half a mile into the Earth this is the gold bearing quartz vein that the miners was seeking quartz forms from a liquid and as it solidifies it somehow traps lumps of gold inside it it is loaded with gold if we break these quartz veins open though we can see perhaps small amounts of gold within the quartz this is just an amazing piece of quartz you can see all the free gold in it it's just bright and glistens there are actually Clues to how the gold got here within the quartz that was deposited with the gold trapped inside the quartz are tiny bubbles of fluid they are minute remnants of a stream of water and minerals that once gushed up this vein analysis of these fluid bubbles has revealed the extreme conditions that created the gold seam that gold was deposited at 600¬∞ fah it was a very very hot fluid that brought the gold and the carts to this location and deposited the vein but it was a mystery what was the driving force creating all this hot fluid which carried the gold in an Old Quarry nearby lies a clue the gold bearing quartz vein here stained Brown is flanked by strange beds of altered Rock when the old timers saw rocks like this they would get excited they knew they were getting close to the source of the gold they would see these rocks had change their color and then they would get to the big motherload quartz vein the the source of most of the gold or this quartz vein is sandwiched between these altered rocks and looking at these altered rocks you see they're all deformed they're up on end they're sheared up they're broken they're folded these veins run for hundreds of miles in a north south Direction similar sandwiches of gold quartz and broken rock are found along the entire length of C California and strangely they all run parallel to the coast whatever immense Force shattered these rocks must also have created the hot fluid which carried and concentrated the gold but what was it geologists finally solved the mystery in the 1950s when the Revolutionary theory of plate tectonics shed light upon how California and its mountains were made they discovered that beneath the Pacific Ocean a giant plate of the Earth's crust moved eastwards it plowed into the American continent crumpling huge slabs of the seafloor as it went if this big rock is ancient North America over the last 300 million years we had a spreading ocean floor pushed the ocean and sediments on top of the ocean against North America and stacked these pieces of ocean floor and sediments on ocean floor up on end against Western North America California was pushed above the waves a mountainous mass of crushed crumpled and upended rocks separated by huge cracks running deep into the crust creating a landscape compiled of giant slabs stacked parallel to the coast this immense mountain building process also had the power to create a piping hot fluid buried rocks were squashed under unbearable pressure they superheated and a 600¬∞ fluid was squeezed from them like water running in a river this piping hot fluid had the ability to concentrate the scattered gold as it washed through the rock it leeched out minute particles of gold creating a mineral Rich soup it poured into the giant cracks which pipelined it to the surface as the fluid cooled the gold coagulated and the quartz crystallized forming a solid gold bearing quartz vein in total 35 million ounces of this mountain gold were blasted out of California one of the most profitable gold mining areas of its time wherever you have oceanic plates colliding with the edge of a continent you're always going to create fluid you're always going to move those Trace Amounts of gold and that will get focused into major faults to form large load gold deposits that part of the mountain building process similar gold-bearing quartz veins lie beneath the coastal mountains all around the Pacific Rim where the ocean floor has crumbled under gigantic Earth forces scientists investigating how California's Mountain gold formed have found ancient fluid bubbles proof that a hot liquid deposited the quartz and gold parallel beds of broken altered rock evidence that the gold Rich fluid was squeezed from rocks as mountains formed by the 1880s only 30 years after the first gold strike California's Mountain gold became increasingly difficult to find by then gold hunters in neighboring Nevada had stumbled upon an entirely different type of gold deposit but it was the sort of deposit that could drive men to murder in the 19th century 49ers found 70 million ounces of river gold then they began to rans sack the motherload blasting out over 35 million ounces of Mountain gold squeezed from the Rocks as California formed for many years scientists believed that only the Colossal forces that created mountains had the power to concentrate gold scattered throughout the Rocks but gold strikes made in neighboring Nevada were to shatter this Theory massive gold veins were found in the sagebrush Hills of the desert a tidal wave of gold Hunters left California heading east the almost Uncharted desol state of Nevada began to light up with life as gold strikes were made across the high desert this was the gunslinging wild west and the rough mining town of bodh had one of the toughest reputations it's hard to imagine more than 8,500 people up along this stretch here lawlessness lots of fights breaking out lots of saloons op dens and broths it was said that a man a day was killed in bod and some historians believe the fickle geology of these gold deposits may have played a part in this murder rate here the veins were much more segmented and broken up so while one Miner might be mining along on the vein another minor might not be which would lead to animosity and tension an occasional fight geologists realized that unlike California's gold scenes which ran parallel to the coast Nevadas were scattered randomly across the desert the hunt was on to understand why Nevada's gold veins were so chaotic 300 M Northeast of the cramped old mine in bodh is the Midas mine large enough to drive a truck down it's one of a handful of remaining gold quartz mines in Nevada and it's a geologist's paradise it's wonderful to have an underground mind because when you go underground you have a three-dimensional picture of the geology it really helps you get a feel for what Clues to be looking at uh that we might see on the surface that we might see better expressed underground working Minds like Midas have become geological Laboratories and are helping to unlock the mystery of Nevada's scattered gold veins every day the miners drill the face and pack it with explosives exposing new networks of quartz veins this is just like the old days but more high-tech they're going to drill the face out load it with explosives and blow it up 450 lbs of explosives are about to blow to reveal the gold bearing quartz [Music] vein that was great and to think it's so much safer than what the oldtimers had to go through once the dust settles it's possible to take a closer look this is quite a nice big quartz vein if I compare these quartz veins to the veins that I've seen in California they're substantially different for one if I look at these bands these dark gray bands in here these gray bands are the first sign that something very strange has happened here in a hand sample I'll see that there's lots of gray material all that gray material is silver if I look you closer I can see little fine flecks of yellow that's gold The Source rock that formed all of these veins was much different than the source rock that caused the California veins to form the California veins only have gold and these are loaded with silver and the clue to the identity of the source of Nevada's gold lies either side of the quartz vein unlike California these wall rocks are not crushed and have never been on the ocean floor this wall rock is of a volcanic origin very similar to like Mount St Helen's so it wasn't mountain building that concentrated the gold and silver in this vein it was a volcanic process perhaps the Midas mine was once a giant volcano geologists went looking for Clues not inside the mine but directly above it everywhere above the mest mine we see these strange outcrops they're flat on the top of like a table and if I look closer I can see fine little bands and layers the outcrop is made of thin layers less than an eighth of an inch thick and there are thousands stacked on top of each other like a deck of cards you've got Browns and yellows whites and purples understanding outcrops like this will help us understand why gold is deposited at such shallow depths within the mightest mine these distinctive layered rocks are not formed by a volcano but another type of volcanic process that can still be seen today in gerlock Northwest Nevada in the middle of the dry Black Rock Desert they found a mysterious Oasis and rising out of the landscape a spectacular multicolored hot spring one of over 300 in Nevada this bizarre geological Wonder began to form just 45 years [Music] ago volcanic processes beneath the Earth heat the groundwater it spills out at the surface and like a boiling tea kettle dumps a layer of mineral scale the water is slowly running over the tops of these Terraces it's depositing minerals in fine little sheets kind of like a deck of cards or a book on end this rock from over there has fine laminations or layers rocks like these and Terraces like those are found right above the Midas mind which tells me that Midas was once an enormous hotring geologists realized it was hot springs that brought the gold and silver quartz veins to the surface in Nevada Gold and Silver particles are scattered in molten rocks deep inside the Earth this hot rock released a Golden silverr Fluid as rainwater soaked into the ground it reached the scorching rocks deep in the crust and superheated to 900¬∞ F hot and buoyant the water began to rise sucking up the gold and silver soup as it went as it neared the surface the water boiled and dumped bands of silver and flex of gold in the chaotic fractured pip work of the hot spring imagine this landscape 15 million years ago volcanoes as far as the eye could see Hot Springs dotting the landscape here and [Music] there gold is forming at this moment in Hot Springs all over the world even Yellowstone has traces of gold in its water one of the world's biggest and most profitable gold mines yanaka Northern Peru is a gold and silver deposit which man has plundered since the rule of the Inca 800 years ago high in the volcanic Andes it's a massive 535 square miles and has produced over5 billion worth of gold all of it originating beneath a bubbling hot spring scientists investigating how gold silver veins formed in Nevada have found volcanic wall Rock proof that the gold Rich fluid came from molten rock and a multicolored layered outcrop evidence that ancient Hot Springs deposited gold in Nevada Nevada's hot spring gold deposits yielded over 40 million ounces of gold and 500 million ounces of silver but by 1920 Nevada's gold seams were increasingly uneconomical to mine the desert became littered with ghost towns it looked like America had run out of gold but in 1961 a new type of deposit was found but it couldn't be seen or touched it was invisible it would become the biggest strike in the history of America's [Music] gold America's gold was concentrated by incredible mountain building forces that formed California and Volcanic processes deep beneath Nevada's Hot Springs but as the deposits became exhausted geologists frantically searched for new stashes of gold then in 1961 geologist and gold prospector John Livermore noticed a suspicious 50-mile long crack in the middle of Nevada called the Carin Trend and set out to investigate John Livermore came to the Hills following up a theory that gold deposits would be aligned directly above a deep Kraken ear's crust he come up to out crops like this and he would go ahead and want to look at them the rocks are a strange mixture of mud and quartz a mineral created in hot fluid and a good clue that gold might be deposited nearby based on his experience he knew a lot of hot fluid had come up up this crack however he couldn't see any evidence of gold no quartz veins no visible gold but on a hunch he sampled this rock took it back to the assay lab to see if there was any gold in it in assay Labs rocks are crushed and blasted in a furnace to over, 1800¬∞ and as the liquid rock cools the minerals begin to separate at the end this process something extraordinary has happened an ordinary looking Rock actually contained a grain of gold at a concentration of about 5,000 times you would normally see in the earth doesn't look like much but this is what they mine every day livermore's hunch paid off 50 m long and 5 mil wide the Carlin trend is now one of the largest mining districts in the world this vast man-made pit is big enough to be seen from space this is the Betsy post pit one of the world's largest gold Vines contains 45 million ounces of gold they have to mine 10 tons of rock in order to get 1 ounce out as you can see it's huge 2 mil long mile wide 2,000 ft deep [Music] because gold is so valuable the extraction of just a few thousand ounces a day pays for this extraordinary mining operation and removing the gold ore requires drastic [Music] action wow that's what 400,000 of explosives looks like giant diggers work 24 hours a day Excavating over 90 million tons of rock a year enough to cover Central Park in 55 ft of rubble but within this raw gold ore not a speck of gold has ever been seen with the naked eye the mystery is where's the gold you can't see it the rocks look really ordinary the clue to where this gold is hidden is the intern structure of this rock magnified 500 times the gold is still invisible but this rock is an extraordinary lattice of quartz and mud perforated with strange cavities it looks like a honeycomb like something's eaten away at it clearly some strange geologic process has concentrated in Hidden the gold in the Rock scientists realized if they were going to solve the puzzle of how gold came to be hiding in in these rocks first they would have to understand where the Rocks came from a clue was found in the 19 century by cattle rancher absolum Leman in the Eastern reaches of [Music] Nevada in 1885 abson Leman stumbled upon a hole in the ground and with rope and Lantern he lowered himself in the earth and the discovered this beautiful cave system with some of the most spectacular cave formations in the world the solid foundations of this cave are made of a messy mixture of mud and calcium carbonate shells they are the remains of tiny sea creatures evidence that Nevada was once covered by an ancient tropical sea for millions and millions of years creatures with shells composed Ed of calcium carbonate began to rain down through the ocean and accumulate on the seaf Flor forming this calcarius ooze later this ooze hardened into a sedimentary rock called Limestone these extraordinary structures in the cave were formed when water eroded the huge Limestone bed that sits underneath Nevada and back over at the Carlin Trend scientists noticed that the gold ore was made of a very similar type of rock they figured out that the Leman cave Limestone and Carlin Tren gold ore must once have been the same rock this is fresh Limestone this is gold ore clearly something happened to change this rock into this spongy gold-bearing ore well the clue is in the chemical reactivity of this limestone if I put the loot hydrochloric acid on this Limestone note how it fizzes very reactive the acid is eating away at the Rock now if I put the acid on the spongy gold ore no reaction the fluid is soaking into the Rock like a sponge scientists concluded the reason Carlin Tren gold or did not Fizz is that it had already been attacked by an acid beneath the bed of limestone at Carlin is a gigantic vertical crack geologists now believe that a blast of hot acidic goldrich fluid was once forced upwards from deep within the Earth it streamed through the crack drenching the Limestone the acid ate into it leaving a sponge like muddy framework behind and in the cavities it dumped quartz and the most minute sprinklings of gold it's only been very recently that scientists have been able to use even more sophisticated Imaging equipment microscopy to image down to the scale of individual atoms magnified 100,000 times tiny specks of sub microscopic gold can be seen embedded in the Rock zooming in further a staggering 4 million times the gold particle is finally revealed this Fleck of gold is only 5 nanometers in diameter 1 millionth the size of a pin head and each tiny white dot is an individual gold atom [Music] these ordinary looking rocks have produced 65 million ounces of gold from a single crack in the earth known as the Carin Trend and it's made the United States the fourth largest gold producer in the world scientists investigating how Nevada's gold ore formed have found a sponge-like rock structure suggesting that something ate away at the Limestone and gold ore not reacting with acid evidence that an acidic fluid had already attacked the Limestone showering it with minute particles of gold similar Carlin type deposits have since been discovered yielding a further 35 million ounces of gold yet these discoveries may only be the tip of the iceberg geologists are now using state-of-the-art equipment hoping to unlock millions of ounces of American Gold trapped deep beneath the Nevada desert throughout world history over 5 billion ounces of gold have been recovered by man and almost one tenth of this has been found in California and Nevada adding up to a staggering $280 billion worth of bounty how much remains is anyone's guess there is no reason not to assume as much gold exists this has been mined in the past but geologists Prospectors explorationists have found the easy gold in the past Prospectors and geologists homed in on this easy Gold by following geological Clues Exposed on the surface but vast areas of Nevada are covered in a deep layer of mud and gravel that has been eroded from the surrounding mountains geologists believe hordes of gold still lie concealed beneath this layer of gravel unseen by anyone for millions of years finding all this buried gold in an area covering 110,000 square miles is no easy task but one man has the ability to see under the ground using pioneering technology I've got gold in the hills around me I've got good reason to believe there's gold beneath me in the Rocks if I could just see through this sand and gravel this little piece of equipment I believe is going to help me figure that [Music] out the Geo probe is drilling not for rocks but for groundwater 200 ft below the surface and it's this groundwater that holds the key to finding Nevada's hidden gold if there's a gold deposit concealed by the sand and gravel the groundwater will interact with it and you pick up Clues traces of metals associated with gold seep into the groundwater clues that will lead Hodges to the secret location of the gold deposit deep below the surface imagine a an iron bar rusting in a bucket of water the trace metals are going to come out of that rusted iron bar are going to be disseminated in the groundwater and you would be able to sample that groundwater and tell that there was an iron bar somewhere nearby just as we're going to be able to sample this groundwater and know that there's a gold deposit somewhere nearby so in a sense it's like the deposit of gold is creating a scent if Hodges can latch on to a whiff of this scent he can track it back to find the gold once the drill is deep enough Hodges pumps out the [Applause] groundw okay I think I've got enough sample now somewhere in this bucket of Muddy Water I believe we've got some Clues this is no ordinary pickup truck it's a state-of-the-art mobile lab laboratory Hodges measures how many Trace metals are in the groundwater and the scent here is particularly strong and it's telling me that I've likely got a lot more uh Trace Metals arsenic animony Mercury uh copper Le zinc are the kinds of Trace metals that are often associated with gold deposits and looks to me like uh We've moving in the right direction in the same way the old-timers trace the gold up into the mountains Hodes tracks the increasing concentration of Trace Metals in the groundwater it's like a little childhood game of of hide and go seek am I getting hotter or am I getting colder and that makes it a science the net is tightening around the gold deposit the scent is strongest in this 4 square mile Target Zone but it's still too large an area to begin test drilling for gold to focus in further Hodges needs to literally see inside the earth well this instrument here is the gravitometer and it has the ability to measure how dense the rocks are beneath this point just as there's a landscape here in the Horizon behind me there's a landscape in the Bedrock underneath me multiple readings from the gravitometer create a secret treasure map of the terrain submerged beneath the surface gravel from this rock density map Hodges can pinpoint the likely location of the gold deposit he has found a suspect gash in the earth over a mile long and 250 ft below the surface it's a good sign as gold is often found deposited in deep cracks it's time to start drilling for gold the diamond studded drill probes the crack and extracts a cylinder of Bedrock this is the first in a sequence of test drills along the crack and the results are tantalizing after all this traveling around I'm finally able to see the rocks for the first time these rocks have been out of view for millions of years and to me it's it's one of the most exciting things about this line of work I get to look at these rocks before anybody else has ever seen them and I can compare them with the rocks that I've seen elsewhere in the mountains in this piece of core I've seen several different kinds of fragments of rocks uh some of them are quartz quartz we know is good for gold Hodges could be on the verge of a massive Gold Strike adding to his tally of 30 million ounces discovered so far reaching down into the Earth pulling out a sample that says there's gold in it and realizing that you've done it and in a sense it connects you with those oldtimers The Same Spirit of the old west it's exciting it's pioneering geologists like Hodes who will find what's left of America's gold scientists and Prospectors investigating how gold is concentrated around the world have found gold in heavy Black Sands evidence that Rivers concentrate gold on the inside bends parallel beds of broken altered Rock proof that gold Rich fluid was squeezed from California's mountains multicolored layered outc crops show that ancient Hot Springs deposited gold quartz veins in Nevada and spongy gold ore evidence that an acid dumped minute sprinklings of gold in the Rock the Earth does not relinquish her gold treasure easily man's irresistible urge to find gold is the driving force which helped Pioneer the science of geology investigating how gold is concentrated across the world is not just a story of metal and Mining it's an epic tale that has revealed how the Earth is dynamically changing to this day and over billions of years of the planet's history living proof that the Earth is never at rest [Music] Earth a 4.5 billion year old Planet still evolving as continents shift and Clash volcanoes erupt glaciers grow and recede the Earth's crust is carved in countless fascinating ways leaving a trail of geological Mysteries behind this is the story of Hawaii a mountain chain over 80 million years old and home to the most active volcano in the world in this Exquisite volatile landscape scientists hunt for Clues to the Island's Origins clues that may shed new light on the formation of the Earth itself Hawaii the most isolated group of Islands on Earth stretching 1500 mil across the middle of the Pacific Ocean these eight Tropical Islands are one of the youngest geological formations on the planet with stunning beaches huge canyons and the biggest volcanoes on Earth this is where Paradise meets hell the investigation into how Hawaii was formed began in 1934 Dutch geophysicist Felix Maness invented the gravimeter an incredible machine which enabled scientists to accurately measure gravity for the first time with his Cutting Edge technology Maness was able to calculate the gravitational forces at work on the big island and using this data determine its size his results revealed that the big island was like a gigantic ice ber only its tip was visible above the ocean but drain away the water and its true size is remarkable the island is twice the height of Everest and so massive that Everest could fit inside it 140 [Music] times geologist Mike Poland heads to the top of the mountain Mona the highest point on the big island to get a sense of its true enormity [Music] we're standing at the top of Mona volcano which is the tallest mountain in the world it's 13,796 ft above sea level but it goes all the way down to the ocean floor and ends up being about 56,000 ft high this giant island is the largest in the United States and bigger than all the other Hawaiian Islands put together intrigued scientists set out to discover what could have created such a huge land mass 10,000 ft below the peak of Mona and 70 Mi to the South the prime suspect is playing to see the awesome kilaa volcano we like to call kilway the most active volcano in the world because it's been erupting continuously since 1983 it has been going every day almost non-stop since that time since early 2008 it's been even more active cuz now we have the summit eruption as well so now kilway is perhaps by two times the most active volcano in the world but this volcano is not predictable although the Summit is no longer spewing out lava 12 Mi down on the south flank of the volcano is an active vent for the last 25 years lava has been gushing out of the side of the volcano from this vent with no signs of stopping homes towns and forests are swallowed up by scorching hot lava with each new flow layer upon layer of black crust builds covering the island in volcanic rock could this huge island have been built entirely by lava experts needed to figure out exactly how much lava kilaa produces their first clue can be found all over the volcano clinging to the rocks are yellow crystals these are sulfur crystals and tell scientists that Kila a volcano is releasing vast amounts of sulfur dioxide gas to determine just how much the volcano is producing researchers take regular measurements the amount of sulfur dioxide that esses from the magma is tied directly to the amount of magma that's coming out of the ground the amount of lava that's erupted so by measuring the amount of sulfur dioxide we can use that number to calculate how much lava is being erupted these samples reveal staggering results kilowa could be producing 100 million C cubic yards of lava a year more than any volcano on Earth but there isn't this much lava flowing across the surface so where does the rest of it Go geologists ventured below the surface into the guts of the volcano to investigate stretching 400 ft into the dark is a strange tunnel just like a Subway tunnel but it's not a man-made structure it's part of a vast NE nwork of tubes that hold the key to how much lava moves around the island we're standing in thirston lava tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and this lava tube was one of the main conduits for lava that was flowing from kway Summit to the sea in an eruption that occurred about 500 years ago so once this tube system has been established you essentially have an underground river of lava so these tube systems can be very longlived and very efficient Delivery Systems for lava the lava is so hot it burns a channel into the Rocks beneath it this incredible time-lapse footage shows that because the top of the flow is still exposed to the air it cools and crusts over below this crust a tunnel forms through which the lava continues to flow but how much lava can these tubes carry back on the surface Dr Ken H Han is carefully inspecting the lava fields to find an active tube only inches beneath his feet could be a tunnel full of 2,000 de lava Dr Han is on the lookout for a skylight a window in the ceiling of a tube they can come and go within days and are a sure sign of an active lava tube you can see the lava glowing inside lava tube this one's about 10 to 15 ft wide and probably about 5 ft deep and it's about 2000¬∞ F and it glows like the sun these hidden tunnels keep the lava insulated and hot preventing it from Cooling and turning into Solid Rock enabling it to travel further and faster than lava on the surface what we're looking at is on the order of about 5 cubic yards every second going in this lava tube underneath us and that's the equivalent of about a dump truck worth of lava every 2 seconds so if I was standing on the freeway what you would see is one dump truck after another dump truck after another dump truck going by me here transporting a phenomenal amount of material hundreds of these expressways crisscross the island carrying lava underground up to 30 Mi until it reaches its inevitable destination the ocean and when 2,000 Dee lava meets seawater the results are [Music] spectacular this interaction is key to how the Big Island was created and is continually growing when the lava hits the ocean it's extremely hot and it shatters into lots of little pieces so what it does is leave a lot of black sand behind it layer upon layer of this black Sandy Rubble slowly piles up on the ocean floor until it forms a new beach new lava on the surface runs across this beach cooling slow to form a new piece of solid land on Sandy foundations this massive island is built on piles of loose Rubble we're looking right here at the process by which the Hawaiian Islands grow the big island is the fastest growing piece of land on Earth as lava from kilaa adds 20 football fields a year to its already colossal size but this just isn't enough more lava is needed to build this huge island so just where is it coming from the cluer in the landscape itself while kilaa forms only one Peak on the island four other Mega structures Tower over the landscape over a million years ago there was no big island of Hawaii it started as a very small island which was the volcano of Kohala which grew out of the ocean over time more volcanoes started to grow Mon and huaai came next growing into tremendous mountains monolo was the next volcano to grow and kilaa is the youngest of the big Islands volcanoes over a million years lava from these five volcanoes slowly built the Big Island up from the sea floor the biggest island in the United States is one big volcanic [Music] rock the mystery of how Hawaii was made is slowly unraveling as the evidence emerges from its fiery volcanoes experiments in the 1930s revealed that the big island is a vast structure stretching 3 Mi down to the sea floor readings of sulfur dioxide gas show that kilaa produces more lava than any other volcano on Earth the landscape reveals that lava from five volcanoes built the island the big island of Hawaii is a stunning Wilderness dominated by fire and destruction but what force on Earth could create the most active volcano in the world 2,000 mil from the nearest land in the middle of the Pacific Hawaii is filled with evidence of a volcanic past the eight islands are made up of 15 Mammoth volcanoes mikai boasts two huge mountains the big island is dominated by the Giant monoa and in Honolulu houses are crowded around the now extinct Diamond Head crater geologists had figured out that the big island was created by five volcanoes next they wanted to know how the entire chain had come into existence 7,000 mil away off the coast of Indonesia is the mighty katoa ever since it exploded in 1883 scientists have been trying to understand the forces that create volcanoes experts plotted all the active volcanoes in the world on a map and an extraordinary fact emerged 80% lay around the edge of the Pacific Ocean this long line of volcanoes became known as the ring of fire 452 giant volcanoes make up the ring and it is thought that eruptions began in this area over 36 million years ago during the 1950s and 60s a theory emerged that finally began to make sense of these fire mountains geologists realized that the Earth's crust was made up of eight major and many minor plates fitting together like a giant jigsaw puzzle they move relative to one another sometimes they intersect sometimes they diverge these plate boundaries are where we see most geologic activity for example along the Pacific Ring of Fire where there's lots of volcanoes and earthquakes that marks plate boundary locations [Music] the theory was called subduction when tectonic plates collide the heavier oceanic plate is forced down into the Earth's intensely hot interior taking water with it the water forces magma to swirl up and push through the plate where it forms volcanoes but when geologists looked at the volcanoes of Hawaii it was clear the theory didn't fit they couldn't have been created as the plates collided because they sit 2,000 miles from the nearest boundary here in Hawaii we're in the middle of a plate so we wouldn't expect to see that much activity that's another bit of evidence that there's got to be some anomaly here that's causing all of the melting we see in the middle of this large plate puzzled geologists decided to look at the volcanoes of Hawaii in the hope they might give up their secrets but all they found were more differences most of the world's volcanoes are cone-shaped with steep sides many thousands of feet tall but Hawaii's volcanoes look completely different we call these volcanoes shield volcanoes because of their shape you can look at behind me at monoa it's got these very smooth sloping flanks it's like a warrior Shield if it's put on its end digging deeper geologists decided to test the lava and found that Hawaiian volcanoes produce a distinct type of lava called Basalt Basalt lava is made of rocks which have been heated up to 2,000 de not only is it the hottest lava in the world it's also some of the most fluid and this makes it terrifyingly unpredictable we got to get out of here get out of here the lava that erupts here in Hawaii is very runny it's much runnier than the kind of lavas that erupt from places like Mount reneer or Mount St Helens which is much stickier it's like comparing honey to toothpaste it's this difference in the consistency of the lava that gives Hawaii's volcanoes their dramatically different shape the sides of the volcanoes here are gently sloping because those lava flows can just run out as they need to the lava flows at places like Mount rineer and Mount St Helens being very sticky stay close to the volcano and build up very steep-sided volcanic cones [Music] geologists had uncovered crucial evidence but they still did not understand what kind of force could create volcanoes in the middle of a plate 2,000 mi from the nearest [Music] boundary but whatever that Force turned out to be would have to be enormous big enough to quite literally move a mountain at the summit of the big Island's kilaa volcano Dr Mike Poland is using sophisticated global positioning equipment to measure changes in the volcano's size GPS is a tool for locating yourself anywhere on the surface of the Earth and you may be familiar with this from seeing GPS units in cars this is a different type of GPS it's much more accurate and that allows us to see how the ground is moving at centimeter level scales this Cutting Edge technology is crucial to scientists in their struggle to understand the forces working beneath Hawaii so we've got this GPS setup here we also have a GPS setup on the far side of the Caldera Now by looking at how the distance between those GPS stations is changing we can get an idea of whether or not the volcano is inflating or deflating if it's inflating like a balloon it means that there's magma that's accumulating beneath the surface and if it's deflating it may mean that there's magma that's leaving the subsurface and over the past years actually these stations have gotten farther apart from one another by almost a foot the kind of force necessary to inflate the volcano to spread the Caldera wider by one foot is tremendous and it's a very good sign of magma that's accumulating beneath the surface and maybe getting ready to erupt evidence was mounting that a huge and unexplained force was at work beneath the chain the volcanoes of Hawaii do not emerge from a plate boundary but rise up right in the middle of the Pacific Plate Hawaii's lava is dramatically different to that produced by the rest of the volcanoes in the Pacific the islands of Hawaii were a thorn in the side of geology but although they remained an unexplained mystery geologists weren't about to give up and the answers they would find were so incredible that the debate they created still rages to this day [Music] the puzzle of what created the islands of Hawaii seemed impossible to solve the mystery only deepened when in the 1950s the US Navy mapped the ocean floor with sonar they revealed a series of underwater mountains known as sea mounts that extended far beyond the chain of eight Hawaiian Islands to the Northwest are a whole string of sea mountains we call sea mounts those are sunken volcanic mountains many of them with Reefs on top of them over 80 sea mounts and 19 Islands form this sequence known as the Hawaiian Emperor seamount chain you're looking at a total distance from the big island of Hawaii out to Midway and all the way up to Russia of about 3200 miles is one of the longest mountain chains in the world but very little of it is above sea [Music] level in 1963 Canadian geologist Jay tuo Wilson turned his attentions to the Hawaiian [Music] Islands he was struck by the fact that both the Hawaiian islands and seamounts form a straight line that courses through the middle of the Pacific straight lines are incredibly rare in nature they don't occur by accident especially not a line over 3,000 M long Wilson believed that one single Force must have created this vast chain of volcanic islands and sea [Music] mounts Wilson also made a very simple and yet incredibly astute deduction the further the islands of Hawaii were from the Big Island The Greener they got and for Wilson Greener meant older he noticed that the landscape on the big island is like a Black Desert a Barren Wilderness with only a few seedlings peeping through the lava fresh lava flows regularly Scorch the Earth killing any plant life but move north along the chain and the islands become increasingly green Wilson believed that on each successive Island more time has passed since the last eruption allowing more plants to grow 2 years later using radiometric techniques scientists dated Rock samples from each of the islands their results confirmed Wilson's hunch and proved that the islands increased in [Music] age Dr po land has been collecting some of these Rock samples and has brought them to the Big [Music] Island this rock right here is from the lava flow that we're standing on this is one of the youngest rocks on the island and in fact we could go and pick up some lava that formed yesterday if it weren't too hot we move down to the middle of the chain we get this rock here which is from aahu and this is about 3 and2 million years old [Music] this rock here is from a lava flow on the island of Kawai it's from the island that's the farthest away from where we are today on the big island you notice how dull it is that's because it is very old it's about 5 million years old Wilson pulled together evidence from Rock dating and the straight line forged by the islands and came up with a single theory he proposed that Hawaii was created by something called called a hot spot an exceptionally hot region beneath the earth's crust that was concentrated under Hawaii's Big Island as the Pacific Plate moved slowly over this hot spot the immense heat punched through the crust to form a chain of volcanic islands so this hot spot is a a constant and stationary source of heat beneath the earth's surface it's like a blowtorch pointed up at the surface of the Earth and as the Earth surface moves over that blowtorch it punches through creating a chain of islands and undersea mountains and that's what we're seeing in Hawaii today this theory was a geological Master stroke it didn't just explain how Hawaii was created it also confirmed one of the most radical theories of the 20th century the theory of plate tectonics here at last was evidence that the vast lumbering plates that made up the Earth were moving tuzo Wilson's hotspot Theory changed our understanding of our planet forever but it also left behind a controversy that still rages to this [Music] day how was the hotspot created ever since scientists understood that volcanism in Hawaii was driven by this hot spot the question then became what drives the hotspot what causes the Hotpot on the barren slopes of Mona on the big island Mike Poland has found a clue so what we're looking at here is what we call a xenolith it's basically a foreign piece of rock that's trapped in this lava flow it's where this foreign piece of Rock has come from that's truly startling the green mineral you're seeing in this xenolith here is a mineral called Olivine and it really indicates that this chunk here came from someplace very deep within the Earth Olivine is usually found hundreds of miles beneath the surface its presence here is good evidence that the Hotpot is powered by something deep within the Earth and in the 1970s American geologists finally came up with a groundbreaking Theory they theorize that below the hot spot lies a plume of hot rock which Rises up through the Earth's interior two or 300 mil below the surface it starts to spread out forming a huge Dome the very top of this is the hot spot scientists call this phenomenon a mantle plume no one really knows how deep it goes but some scientists have come to the extraordinary conclusion that it may stretch all the way down to the very core core of our planet it is possible that the plume extends all the way down to the cor manal boundary and frankly that makes good sense to me if you look at the size of the Hawaiian island [Music] [Applause] chain it's a huge feature it's been around for tens of millions of years to me that's not something that can be explained by something that's that's just near the surface I think it's got to be something quite deep within the Earth suddenly experts realized plumes were the answer to hundreds of geological Mysteries which had long puzzled science such as the existence of Icelandic volcanoes the galapagus: Planet Rock dating and the unusually straight alignment of the island chain revealed that the Pacific Plate is moving over a stationary Hots spot Olivine Rock erupted on Hawaii's Big Island shows this hot spot is powered by a mantle plume originating from the very bowels of the Earth but while the Hawaiian Islands have been created by this very hot spot another equally powerful force is working to destroy them in Hawaii a strange force is at work while the big island is growing by 11,000 square ft a year the islands at the Northern end of the chain are Vanishing into the Pacific at a rate of 2,400 sare ft a year these are islands are disappearing fast geologists were curious about what force could cause them to vanish they found their first clue in early scientific studies 1950s underwater sea mapping produced a wealth of data and these results revealed something completely unexpected Heat and pressure from the hotspot had forced up the ocean floor creating a bulge 750 Mi long and 500 ft High the chain is raised by the swell but as the islands move away from the hot spot they slide off the swollen crust sinking further and further eventually as they move northward at about 8 to 10 cm that's about 3 and 1 12 in per year so in say another um 1 to two million years this island will probably be as much as 3 to 4,000 ft lower probably have relatively little fresh water on it and not be very inhabitable the hot spot that created the islands also seals their fate but the islands aren't just sinking they're shrinking too erosion is the Culp it it's slowly destroying the islands and nowhere is this more apparent than on Kawai the oldest island of [Music] Hawaii here along the coastline intense weathering may have produced some of the most breathtaking natural features in the world but it is also evidence of the Island's inherent flaw an erosion isn't just taking place at the coast it's happening all over the island [Music] WEA Canyon Hawaii's Grand Canyon a 10mile scar through kawai's green Wilderness over 3,000 ft deep this Canyon is the most dramatic example of erosion in [Music] Hawaii if you look up to the east you'll see one of the rainiest places in the world Mount W Al Ali rain flows from that mountain down into the [Music] canyon Mount W Al Ali receives over 400 Ines of rain every year which pours out over the island carving out the [Music] canyon but the islands are made of Basalt lava one of the hardest rocks on Earth how could water alone be wearing them away the answer lies in the canyon spectacular red walls the redish color is from the oxidation of the mineral iron which makes up about 10 to 12% of the Lava Rock here it's very similar to the rust that forms on your car so literally we're looking at a highly rusted landscape if you will which makes it very soft so in a sense it's uh somewhat rotten exposed to water the high level of iron in this lava causes the rock to rust and crumble it's the Paradox of the Hawaiian Islands they're made of volcanic basalt one of Nature's hardest rocks but it's fatally flawed this rock which initially was a very dense hard lava you can really break with a hammer we can now actually pull out pieces with our hand combine this crumbling rock with some of the highest rainfall in the world and the result is massive erosion erosion over millions of years but scientists knew that erosion alone couldn't be causing the islands to [Music] disappear on the island of mikai they found evidence that vast tracks of land had disappeared not over millions of years but overnight satellite images revealed that molai is not like the other round islands of Hawaii something strange happened to Maliki is quite obvious just by looking at any map it's not a round volcano part of it is missing it's a thin strip of land with sharp Cliff edges shorn away into steep faces at, 1700 ft these are the highest sea cliffs in the world all the evidence pointed to a sudden cataclysmic event many theories were put forward but it wasn't until the 1980s that geologists got the evidence they desperately needed after the success of earlier underwater mapping the US Navy returned to Hawaii with the world's most advanced sonar system and surveyed the surrounding Waters in incredible detail they discovered the seabed on the Island's north side was littered with gigantic underwater blocks of land some larger than the island of Manhattan geologists took thousands of samples and measured the blocks what they found was incredible these blocks could be fitted back to the Island's steep Cliffs like a giant jigsaw puzzle finally scientists had enough evidence to put together a picture of what had happened radiometric dating confirmed the age of the blocks and showed that they were the result of an event which had taken place over a million years ago geologists knew there could only be one explanation a massive landslide 1 and a half million years ago um there was a very bad day in the Hawaiian Islands the entire North Slope of the island slipped off into the ocean a section 25 mil long and perhaps as much as a mile thick and it did it all at once this huge section of the island crashed into the ocean splitting into massive blocks weighing millions of tons the force with which they crashed into the waves meant they didn't stop dead but continued to move along the ocean floor at an incredible speed it was sudden it was dramatic and we know that because of how far the blocks went they they went down into this trough around the Hawaiian islands and then up the other side and eventually stopped about 200 mil away and for them to go that far means they had to be traveling about 150 160 m hour now really fast and of course it's displacing water while it's doing that so you're creating for the Hawaiian Islands a huge tsunami a tsunami that would have would have reached to the top of the cliffs behind [Music] me a landslide on this scale and at this speed would have produced one of the most awesome and deadly waves ever seen on the planet the main event was over in only 5 minutes and uh and I'm afraid that if you saw that it would be too late because you could run as hard as you like and and you wouldn't get away from the subsequent the subsequent tsunami but what could have caused such catastrophic land failure geologists look to the youngest Island the big island for answers here the island is still building just as mikai once did and experts suspect they will find their answer in the Island's foundations as the new land builds out it's building on sand that's deposited in front of the lava flows and so it's very unstable every once in a while this material collapses leaves the lava unsupported and it breaks and it slides down into the ocean it was a disturbing Discovery all Hawaii's islands were built rapidly and entirely from lava they are all based on the same weak foundations and that means a Landslide could strike anywhere on the south coast of the Big Island there's evidence that another major Landslide could be about to occur a huge tear in the earth points to where a 4,700 squ mile chunk of land is breaking away from the Big Island at a rate of 4 in a year for its size this is the fastest moving tract of land on the planet geologists have calculated that if it were to fall into the ocean it could trigger an earthquake up to magnitude 7 and unleash a colossal tsunami all the cities of Hawaii would be swept away as a mammoth wave races toward the California coast investigators have discovered why Hawaii is disappearing sonar Maps reveal the islands are sliding fing off a swollen section of the Earth's crust kawai's crumbling landscape reveals an inherent flaw in the islands they are made of the hardest rock on Earth but exposed to water they rapidly break down and miky's dramatic Cliffs shorn away overnight are evidence of catastrophic landslides sinking eroding and crashing into the Pacific eventually even the Big Island will be just another underwater mountain in the long chain hidden beneath the waves but the story of Hawaii is far from over Rumblings from under the sea tell scientists a new monster may be rising from the waves now they must Venture into one of the most hostile environments on Earth where fire meets water the story of Hawaii is an incredible tale of giant volcanoes unimaginable catastrophe and Vanishing Islands but it doesn't end here because only 20 mi off the big Islands beaches something strange is stirring in the depths in the 1950s seaf surveys revealed that an underwater volcano sat right on the flanks of the Big Island geologists were intrigued by this giant seamount rising up 2 miles from the ocean floor and named it Loy he scientists were desperate to learn more but it wasn't until 40 years later when the technology became available that they were able to dive down and investigate the seamount the scientists were very interested to go down and actually see what the situation was so they took the research submarine Alvin who's a very famous three-person sub that found the Titanic and they went down to the seamount and found that there was a huge pile of volcanic rocks that were all freshly broken and here's a sample this is a very heavy Rock and it's a top of a pillow lava pillow lava was evidence of a very recent [Music] eruption scientists had believed Loi to be an ancient volcano extinct for thousands of years but this discovery called for some radical rethinking could Loi be alive and erupting experts struggled for 11 years to find indisputable proof mapping the seamount extensively and taking thousands of samples until finally they came across the piece of evidence they had been searching for now it wasn't until 1996 that really The Smoking Gun was discovered in October of that year there was a huge number of Siz mic events occurring that the people of the volcano Observatory discovered but they quickly realized that the source of the seismic activity was not on the island here it was offshore they did the best estimates they could and it all pointed to the sea mount off the south end of the Big Island this swarm of earthquakes coming from Lui were the largest number ever recorded from any Hawaiian volcano scientists knew they were on the verge of an incredible Discovery desperate to witness winess the action as it happened scientists rushed to the heart of the activity the trick was to get out there while the eruption was [Music] occurring so we went out there there was a tremendous amount of seismic activity from the ship you could actually hear the noise of the earthquake venturing into the unknown a team from the University of Hawaii dived 3,000 ft down into this dangerous and unpredictable environment Everywhere You Could See were mounds of broken up Rock and this murky water was this precipice but the top of the seamount had suddenly collapsed to create this pit crater that was hundreds of feet across and hundreds of feet deep and this was the first evidence for really active volcanic activity experts had just missed one of the most violent eruptions Hawaii had ever seen But as the dust settled they were able to survey the aftermath lava had poured out of the volcano draining the summit and causing it to collapse the team finally had proof that Loi was an active volcano which will continue to erupt and grow until it forms a new island the next in the Hawaiian chain [Music] the Assumption was there had to be another volcano coming up one of these days no one knew whether that was going to happen in her lifetime or not but it's very rewarding for the scientists to realize that now the next volcano in the sequence has been discovered Loi is apparently it as lava continues to spew from its submerged Summit Loi will build until it rises out of the Pacific the Pacific Plate will shift carrying the big island off the hotspot and lei will take its place at the head of the Hawaiian chain experts had studied the ancient islands of Hawaii for hundreds of years theorizing about how they were created but they never imagined they would have the opportunity to witness it for [Music] themselves Loi provides us with a real unique Laboratory it gives us a window back into the past this is our one chance to see how it worked before the islands reached the [Music] surface reviewing all the evidence investigators finally understand how the Hawaiian chain was created gravity readings taken in the 1930s show that the big island is 140 times bigger than Mount Everest further investigation reveals that it is made entirely from basalt lava from five volcanoes rocks created deep underground are found within the lava and show the Island's volcanoes are fueled by something from deep within the earth a mantle plume but high levels of iron in Hawaii's Basalt lava caus the islands to crumble and the Steep Cliffs of molai are evidence of Mega landslides underwater lava is proof that a new volcano is stirring the next island in the chain that will eventually emerge from beneath the waves Hawaii's dramatic cycle of birth and death is more than just a geological Wonder it's transformed geologists understanding of the entire planet on Hawaii we can see for ourselves how the earth is [Music] made e"
