        "transcription": "mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that focuses on the design analysis and manufacturing of mechanical systems this major is highly math especially calculus and physics-based one of the great things about mechanical engineering is that is highly versatile in what you can do students who graduate as a mechanical engineering major can go into construction Automotive heating and air conditioning materials robotics work in the energy sector combustion engines and many more now besides mechanical engineering classes you'll take a little bit of everything basically you have to take a few electrical engineering classes to learn about the basics of circuits and possibly some of the basics of electronics as well you have to do a little programming and become decently proficient in mat lab which is a software that allows you to create plots and graphs and do complicated math Way Beyond what your graphing calculator can do you'll possibly have to do a welding class then of course you have to take about two years of math mostly calculus and about one year of physics now the first main class of mechanical engineering would be Statics where you'll look at the physics of systems that aren't moving this would be like looking at the forces and torqus in something like a truss that holds up a bridge where you have to analyze the forces that individual beams feel due to external forces then the next class would be Dynamics where you look at systems that are moving it's similar to your high school physics class with projectile motion momentum energy forces and more but is much more involved you look at the motion of much more comp Le Lex systems have to find things like velocity acceleration energy force and more of different parts of that system then your third year you even take a more advanced version of this class where you look at these complex systems but now in three dimensions so as you can probably already see mechanical engineering involves a lot of advanced physics when you enter your third year you'll take a course called fluid mechanics and in this course you'll study the properties and mechanics of fluids such as air and water this class is very calculous based for example you could study how the pressure of water changes as it flows through a set of pipes in a closed environment as height and pipe dimensions change the principles to solve this are foundational for how your car brakes work this class also includes the physics of how wind turbines work and why they are made the way they are so that they move as much as possible from any amount of wind and you can analyze why different shapes are better or worse and if airplanes interest you you could even learn how wind flows over a wing to produce aerodynamic Force which also applies to car aerodynamics which if optimized increases car's MPG you also take a class called thermodynamics which deals with the relations between heat and other forms of energy such as mechanical electrical or chemical in this class you'll study the combustion engine which applies to cars boats and aircrafts and you'll learn these engines in great depth and see how they are constantly making adjustments to make them more efficient you'll go as far back and learn at how the first steam engine was created and we will learn how similar ideas are still being used in power plant today to produce energy to power your TV turn on your lights and power your appliances you'll then take a vibrations class where you'll analyze the mechanical vibrations that occur in different objects think about if you were to drop a metal object when it hits the ground you might observe or even hear it vibrating well in mechanical systems like planes cars satellites and more that are moving but also contain Parts like Motors and engines that are also moving at very high speeds it's important to analyze the system even down to the vibrations to ensure the system can with understand those vibrations that occur have you ever seen in movies a person make a high-pitch note and it causes something like a glass to shatter that's cuz the sound is making the glass vibrate at just the right frequency called the natural frequency that makes it shatter buildings even need to account for this cuz in the case of an earthquake the building will shake and vibrations will be created this is actually a building in Japan that was structurally built to withstand high winds and strong earthquakes from causing strong vibrations one thing they did was put something called a tuned Mass damper near the top of the building which weighs 728 tons and is something that is engineered to reduce mechanical vibrations that can actually save the building from destruction during natural disasters in 1940 the Tacoma Bridge collapsed and what they found afterwards was the vibrations occurred due to interactions between the bridge and the wind which just kept amplifying until it fell apart like most mechanical engineering classes this one is highly calculus based cuz you have to model very complex systems and motion then you'll take some design classes and these are kind of a combination of materials engineering and mechanical engineering where you'll look at the strength and durability of different materials mechanisms and structures as a mechanical engineer someone might tell you they need a certain motor to make a million Cycles without braking or maybe they needed to run for 10 years without braking this could even apply to just how much weight can a beam support before breaking and how much stress is it subject to with a certain amount of weight now there are a few concentrations within mechanical engineering a few specific ones include Heating and ventilation air conditioning and Refrigeration or HVAC as it's called then mechatronics and Manufacturing now HVAC goes into more vehicle and Indoor Comfort using your knowledge of fluids thermodynamics and heat transfer in HVAC concentration leads to working on maintaining heat and ventilated air in something like a large commercial building cars apartment buildings homes hospitals hotels and more where you'll have to understand how heat travels throughout the building and different materials when you see those ducks in large buildings those have to be carefully placed in order to ensure Ure Comfort throughout the whole building by knowledge of thermodynamics and airflow now it may not seem like it but seeing how these systems actually work can actually be pretty involved then mechatronics is like the combination of mechanical engineering electronics and some computer engineering as a mechanical engineer when it comes to robotics you'd be able to build the robot structurally and make sure it can withstand a certain amount of force but with mechatronics you dive more into also the programming and so with a mechatronics concentration you'd basically have all the subdisciplines necessary to build circuit and program a robot and this is applications in embedded systems sensing and controls Robotics and more now the manufacturing concentration is a little more broad because you can learn things from the design of a part to the actual materials used for the part manufacturing might involve learning techniques that help you predict when a certain part will fail this major will be helpful in teaching you that slight alter ation in design or material of a part can have a drastic impact on the overall price which becomes an important component in the design and manufacturing of Parts related to profit margins and running a business now these are just some examples of concentrations but there are many more subdisciplines and as a mechanical engineer you have a lot of flexibility as a mechanical engineer you could work on cars but to be more specific you could work on improving the engine to make it more efficient you could work on the suspension of the car to ensure can handle the forces the car is subject to like could it handle going over a speed bump too fast or you could do crash testing and look at the materials and shape of the car to see what it can withstand and how it would affect a person inside or you can maybe analyze how air flows over or through the car and optimize its aerodynamics to make it go faster from knowledge of your fluids classes and this could even be applied to planes or drones a mechanical engineer could also work with biomedical Engineers on things like prosthetic body parts they might need to help make sure the mechanism is strong enough to withstand the forces they'll have to put up with or they might have to decide what's the best material to use mechanical engineers can also work on Alternative forms of energy like on wind farms hydroelectric solar and more they can work on satellites and use mechanics to analyze the vibrations during High acceleration or they can use thermodynamics to analyze the temperature differences that the satellites go through as they orbit the Earth they can work on robotics Weaponry machines and the list just goes on as you can see mechanical engineers really have no limits to what they can see in their career"

        "transcription": "hi everybody it's Rob SN here and I'd like to welcome you to fundamentals of mechanical engineering topic 1.1 um first of all a couple of checks before we get under the way we do have a busy session today so without further Ado can you all hear me clearly please indicate that you can hear me positive response that's a good start and now can you see the arrow pointing to the letter M in mechanical cool so we've got sound and we've got Vision well in this webinar we're going to look at some basic concepts uh concerning work power energy force torque and we're also going to look at some drawings and and friction amongst other things let's start off with Force well force is a push or a pull on on on an object that results from its uh interaction with another object so here we've got a force of 100 Newtons uh because that's the units that we measure force in and we're applying this to this column at an angle of 45¬∞ 5 M from the bottom here so engineer like to do cool things so Engineers could work out how much this column moves because of this Force applied here and uh we could even work out things like bending stresses but not to worry you just now more about that later now the force is a product uh of mass times acceleration Mass being me measured in kilograms and our frame acceleration of course being measured in met per square second and this equation here fals mass time acceleration is known as Newton's second law of emotion if we're going to do work it means that we have to do um or or produce move a force through a distance so the definition here um of work is when a body moves under the influence of a force work is done so we calculate work by multiplying force times the distance through which we move the object energy well we know that energy can't be created or destroyed and um the energy at the unit of energy is the Jewel and there are basically two formats that uh energy can take uh um uh form in first one is potential energy that's the energy stored in Spring for example the energy that a body has uh due to its height uh if you think about a a tank a water tank suspended uh above above a top um the higher that tank is suspended above the top um the more water uh will come out um as the uh the top is is opened the more pressure we'll have kinetic energy well it comes from the the letter the the Greek Kenny meaning motion kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its motion and these are basic things that we're going through now guys so uh we've got to become familiar with them because we will be using them later um potential energy we can calculate that by taking the mass of the object multiplying the the the the distance between the object and some data that we set H multiplied by G the gravitational constant kinetic energy well we can calculate that by taking a half times the mass of the object times its velocity squared and the velocity will be in meters per second okay now we're getting to some useful stuff now power well power is the rate of doing work and the way we can calculate power is uh by measuring the force multiplied by its ex its average velocity and the unit of power is the what well in Industry there not many things that we measure in Watts unless you're in electronics uh normally Machinery that we're um utilizing for driving pumps and compressors for example uh or or conveyors uh is measured in kilowatts the torque is basically is force times radius of application so you can see here we've got a 10 kilogram force on a spanner and we're applying that Force at a distance of one meter from the center of this this bolt here so we get a Torque uh of of of 10 kilogram Force meters so the further away this force is applied the more torque we get the higher this Force becomes here uh over a given distance the more torque we get so torque is a product of force times distance of application from in this case the center of the bolt that's useful if you want to tighten spanners uh tighten up bolts rather now friction is something that Engineers love and hate uh friction um is uh is uh the enemy when we're looking at rotating equipment friction is the friend when we want to stop that rotating equipment from moving and the resisting force uh is called friction Force now there are some laws of friction there's basically four laws that we we need to be familiar with the first law is frictional forces directly proportional to the normal load between the surfaces for any pair of materials the second law says that friction Force depends on the material from which the contact surfaces are made so if we have really rough surfaces then we will have a high friction force between them when we try to move them and the second law says the friction Force for Pure sliding is independent of the area of contact of the surfaces and then the fourth law is that the friction force is independent of the velocity of the sliding of one body relative to the other and here's a couple of examples um if we looked under the microscope at surfaces that might look to the human eye to be um smooth we see we've got this kind of surface here that looks like the Moon and the friction is caused by these tiny little bumps called the parities H and the friction is caused by these bumps rubbing each other now what do you think the purpose of the lubricant is guys what do you think one of the purposes of a lubricant is if we take a look at this little sketch here what do you think one of the purposes of a lubricant would be well obviously to reduce friction but what what would it be aha someone's on the ball that's right well done guys we would want to fill these little gaps and separate separate the two surfaces so they do not come into contact and that is one of the uh purposes of the lubricant and once these surfaces are separated then obviously we reduce the coefficient of friction between the two surfaces so as I say engineers are in constant uh turmoil as to whether they want friction or they don't want friction depends which side of the fence you're on um here we've got a block um with a a normal reaction here of N and we've got a frictional force F that we're applying parallel to this this uh this base if you like and this frictional force is the amount of force that we need to apply to this block in order to get it moving now the friction um um between uh the two blocks um depends on the surface roughness and we've got something called the coefficient of friction and it's denoted by the the Greek letter mu and we can calculate the coefficient of friction between any two surfaces if we know the force that's required to drag the in this case the block along and we know what the normal reaction force is and here's a table I don't know if you can see this very clearly on your screens but let's take a couple of examples here uh let's take cast iron cast iron um when we're sliding has a coefficient of friction of point of 0.15 if we take graphite W sliding well it's it's 0.1 it's 0.1 it's a lot less than cast iion and cast iion is actually uh very good uh because it's filled with graphite let's take let's take iron ion has a coefficient of friction there of about one so you can see we can get these values from mu um for different materials now I just want to explain although this is not on your slides you see that we've got two columns here one says static one says sliding well in order to get the the the block if we go back a couple of slides in order to get this block moving we have to overcome friction static friction so if I drew a little graph here and here's the force what will happen is is as I increase the force I increase the force to try and get it moving and then once I've got it moving that's the force to keep it moving so this here if I can just show you here is the static friction and once it's moving that is the the the the U the friction here in this table here that's the sliding friction there's my little point of so that static friction is this value here and then where the curve flattens out that is the sliding friction so that I hope that explains the two different values there so as I said Engineers always have this dilemma some want friction others don't want friction and friction is pretty useful if you're walking um or you're running um also if you're driving it happens to be uh very useful if you want to stop your car in a hurry um if we didn't have friction you'd be in big trouble uh as this sketch shows here we have a a belt transmitting drive from the engine to various components the alternator the air conditioner uh the fuel pump uh etc etc and not relies on friction so so in this case friction is good okay as I said at the beginning we've got a lot of stuff to get through and it's very diverse here guys so uh let's move on to the next subject which is drawings drawings now drawings are the the main line of communication between the draftsman the originator of the drawing itself and the end user uh and the example given here is between the designer and the machine operator and it's important that we're able to communic communicate what the the draftsman wants the operator the machine operator whatever to produce so the things that are really important in drawings are the type of projection that we use any sections cross sections shown on the drawing as we'll see they're very very useful in supplying information and and then we're going to look at assembly drawings and then we're going to discuss tolerances and fits so let's look at projections well we've got two main um uh projection types that's isometric and oblique and the difference is that an isometric um projection you can see that um the uh Cube here that's shown here is at an angle of 30¬∞ to the horizontal so it's the side here is 30¬∞ in an oblique projection we actually see a true representation of the side of the cube and one side is is at 45¬∞ at 45 degrees there now just to further complicate things we have two systems that we use the first system is called first angle projection which is mainly used in Europe and and you can see here we've got front view side view and plan view similarly in third angle projection which our American friends um favor we've got three views as well but look at the placement we've got plan view here on the top front view below it and side view now how I remember I've got a little trick that I use and and it's something like this um if I can find a color and a pen I don't know what this is going to look like I divide the drawing oh up into three quadrant four quadrants sorry this is the first this is the second this is the third and this is the fourth now where is the front view in third angle projection where is the front view in third angle projection in which quadrant is it okay everybody passed that tough question now let's look at first angle projection let's divide this into four again here's my first quadrant second quadrant third quadrant and fourth quadrant where is my front view now which quadrant is it in first so that's a little trick I use guys you know everybody has their own own methodology for for for for these sort of things that's how I remember when I'm looking at a drawing whether you know I don't have to look at the name or where it was printed in order to assertain what type of projection it is now I hope you'll find that useful to you moving on sectional views are very very useful they they're so powerful guys they really help you understand what's going on what you're looking at um when you look at a drawing and a sectional view is an imaginary slice through um an object so that you can see what it looks like now here in the top view here what we're looking at is we're looking at what looks like a cylinder with a whole drill in the middle and some kind of hidden object here but look if we didn't have a sectional drawing we'd think that that hole went right through wouldn't we the natural fact it doesn't this full section View and the these lines here are called cross-hatching this full section view shows us that that hole is only in the top half of this object it doesn't actually go all the way through um here is a half section uh which we sometimes use now let's take a look at this one here on the right this is mindblowing look at this view here so what we have is in this part the first part of the object here we've got two solid lines now that could be a Groove or it could be a raised portion like it's shown here then we've got a center line here what do you think this could be what what what section do you think this could be just looking at this drawing here what type of section do you think that could be those two lines there what what could they represent well we see one of these things is it yeah it's round but what other section could it be Stefan it wouldn't be a scallop I know what you're saying is it's just like a a u section you wouldn't see a Center Line there it could be an oval yes it could be good one the other thing what about it it could be a rectangle or it could be a square couldn't it what we're seeing is two lines here and there or four lines here so by taking a cross-section in this this case here bb bb shows us the section is actually round how about this guy here it shows you a square hole on there what else could this be here represented by two dotted lines here what else could that be shows here in the is actually square but what else could it be here well it could be a round hole couldn't it could could be drilled um yeah it could be round here it's shown Square natural fact so can you see how this is this is all hidden detail here it's all hidden detail but how using um sectional views how a lot more information is revealed and that's why these are are very powerful details um on a drawing very useful to someone that's got to manufacture this how about these sectional views let's take a look at this plate here wow well this this is countersunk but is it is it a Square counter sunk or is it a taper counter sunk because look at this hole here on the right and look at that hole there on the right they look exactly the same in this view don't they but now take a look in the cross-section we can see this is actually counter sunk Square counter sunk tapered how about this one this obviously it's shown in in detail uh in dotted um lines that would go actually 3/4 of the way around there to represent a tapped hole look at this that looks the same as that and the same as that doesn't it but in this case it's actually a rased face here it's a raise section that's been spot faced it's been machined and it's round it happens to be round so wow do I do I need to explain any more about how powerful sectional views are they do reveal a lot of information don't they let's talk about Dimensions well why do we need gu Dimensions guys why do we need Dimensions now don't give me any of these answers here because it's all the that's all in front of me as well as in front of you but what other reason do you think apart from what's here on the slide do we need dimensions on a drawing well yes um we've got some pretty good answers there but folks the answer that I was looking for is if you have drawings on a a sorry a drawing with dimensions on we said that the purpose of of drawings are to communicate between the draftsman and the operator The Machinist now the operator The Machinist makes the part according to the drawing how do we know it's right how do you how do we know how do we know The Machinist has made the part correctly yes Scott on the money Bullseye yes Bruce yes Roy we compare the dimensions that we measure on the actual manufactured part against those stated in the drawings now just a word about drawings here before we start talking about limits and tolerances because I'm just bringing us into the next subject a little bit prematurely take a look at this drawing can anybody tell me why we would say this part here imagine this we've got two drawings mirror image of each other this this part here there's a mirror image of that part take a look at the way that they're dimensioned what strikes you as being the reason we've labeled this side the left hand side drawing to be correct and this one incorrect we've got all the dimensions that we need here on this this part here on the right all the dimensions that we need on the left but why would we say that this drawing Dimensions here is correct and this one is incorrect well I'll give you a little bit well yeah the first thing that that strikes you is the dimensioning here on the right is nowhere near as clear as the dimensioning on the left it's a lot neater also we're working from a data if you're a machinist I need to know how far away from this side here to put this hole in and that hole in there and then this hole in here so it's very easy I don't have to add up the dimensions um in in this drawing but the the you guys got it right you said we um um are aware that the reason that this is correct is because the drawing is a lot tidier it's a lot easier to understand um we don't have any Dimensions that are actually on the drawing they're away from the drawing so we can actually see the part much clearer I mean this is really confusing what do you think would happen if we sent this down to the machine shop for The Machinist to manufacture what do you think that that might happen there absolutely people 100% correct Well yeah if I was The Machinist I wouldn't be impressed by the drawing either you should good answer um but there's always a a there's a much greater risk of of producing um the wrong article um The Machinist would have to to sit there and try and work through this Maze of Dimensions as to how to produce this article and yes Justin yeah it takes time and time as we know is money so yeah um bigger chance here of producing scrap uh when compared to this dimensioned uh part of the drawing good one very good okay okay moving on um another useful drawing for us um especially if we're going to put parts together as an assembly drawing and an assembly drawing shows how things are put together and generally um the one one can um assemble it it's like a Lego set um if we if we look at this now the assembly drawing shows how things go together and we have a parts list along with the drawing what do you think the parts list helps us to achieve what what purpose does the parts list um serve should I say yes Scott yes it identifies the components because bear in mind people this is an assembly drawing but each individual part has to be machined so in in this column here it says description there's a part part number will actually that's the Pod description really to be to be strictly um strict this is the the uh description it should be there should be a number in here um a machining drawing number in here so that we can identify the component also when you look at the parts list it tells you how many of each part we need and um that's also useful isn't it the x-axis know um Daniel the x is a section it's just to show that this drawing is a section view viewing on a a so in other words I take a hacksaw I cut this imaginary hacksaw I C half and what I'm seeing here on the right of the drawing is the view that I would get if I looked at the component once it's cut in half from left to right any idea what this might be guys what this component might be yeah it's a hydraulic piston it's a hydraulic piston I I I believe it's off a break uh Master cind oh well done Bruce yeah um I believe it's off a break master cylinder well I doesn't tell you that there well done you guys are on the ball today wow look at this exploded assembly I did say it CH us how things go together um I think this is pretty good um in determining where where we are how how um things um um fit together where they should go and you'll notice we've also got item numbers on here what is the purpose of those item numbers why do we have n item numbers on an exploded [Music] assembly yeah okay yep you guys are definitely awake it's to identify the parts uh and to go back and look at the so we can go back refer to the actual uh manufacturing drawing good now before we talked about um you know dimensioning things and um manufacturing things and hopefully we'd get them get them right now we're going to talk a little bit now about limits and fits and the limits of size are the extreme Dimensions the maximum size the minimum size uh which it's permissible for a component to to be to be made now designers often calculate and design a shaft to fit in a hole now the the cost of the the manufacturing of this depends on the limits that we apply to the shaft and to the hole if we make the the the the dimensions of the shaft extremely tight in other words we um allow very very very little for manufacturing errors then nut shaft will be expensive to manufacture and often the designers decide what the uh the final Dimensions should be for formating parts um now limits are normally used uh for cylindrical holes and shafts but they can use be used on any part uh or parts rather that fit together uh regardless of of of what they look like now typically um a limit is the upper and lower tolerance uh for a a a a shaft or hole now we've got different types of fit between components we can have a clearance fit where um a um a a pump shaft fits into a plain bearing and that shaft rotates in the bearing hopefully with some kind of lubrication there um and that is a clearance fit and in ference fit is where there's a negative allowance um you may want to put two halves of a tool together with a dow and the the dowel size is slightly larger than the uh the whole size in in one half of the tool and then we've got something that's in between a clearance fit and an interference fit it's called a transitional fit let's take a look at an example here so we're looking at a drawing of a housing a bearing Bush and a shaft here and a shaft what type of fit do you think that there is between the bearing Bush and the [Music] housing so this shaft will rotate in this bearing Bush and this is fitted inside the [Music] housing well yes it's it's an interference fit it's pressed the bush would be pressed into the housing so that it doesn't rotate now let's look at the shaft we've got the shaft rotating in this bearing Bush here now ignore the drawing what type of fit would you think that the shaft is in the bearing Bush oh some of you are yet you got it already you got it Well Done guys it's a clearance fit it's a clearance fit so what we would do in this case of this assembly is we put nominal sizes for the shaft the bearing Bush and the housing and put clearances sorry put tolerances on to ensure that we get the correct fit and our designers refer to ISO limits and fits and there's a standard which is British standards 4500 um which is a an abbreviated table if you like um and you'll see the table in a moment and you'll understand immediately why we use letters um it's a shorthand basically on on a drawing now all we have to know for the sake of this webinar is that holes are designated by a capital letter and shafts are designated by a lower case so we got h11 H9 h8 H7 which refers to holes and then we've got C11 d10 E9 etc etc which refers to shafts and here's the table here guys now can you imagine producing a drawing and then having to write Free Running Fit not for use for AG is essential but good for temp large temperature variations High running speeds are heavy I'm getting tired just saying it imagine having to put all of this text on a drawing when you can just do this H9 D9 which would you prefer to do write all of this out or put this in your on your dra drawing I think I know what the answer is going to be before I even see um your reply to that one so under clearance fits we have all of these symbols that one would referred to um and these go from loose running to location clearance and all of these are defined by the large uh letter H and a lowercase letter here in this case D transition then we've got different types of transition there's a locational transition fit for accurate location H and it's a compromise between clearance that's a rattling fit and an interference fit where it really has to be pressed in and then we've got location trans transition fit for more accurate location where we've got very very little clearance at all and we're having to um make sure that the parts uh that are fitting together don't move and you see the difference here we've got H7 what is the large letter designate just checking that you're awake okay so in in both cases we got an H7 and in the first case we've got a k6 and the second case we've got an n6 so this is all this is guys is an abbreviated way of saying this to The Machinist and the the everybody that's reading the drawing and here we've got an example here there's a little calculator that shows us that we've got an h8 H7 here our nominal shaft size is 10 mm and we can see here the tolerance we've got here um h8 which is your whole size can be 10 mm plus 22 microns and not any smaller so it can be 10 millim plus 22 microns plus nothing so it's either 10 mm or 10.22 mm that's your hole and similarly for the shaft the shaft is not going to be any bigger than 10 mm but it can be 10 mm minus 0us 15 and that's the why or how we tolerance Things o sorry in order to get the desired fit moving on let's now discuss engineering materials and this is important guys Engineers need to know how materials behave under different conditions now let's get something out of the way the difference between tension and compression is if you compress something you press it together push them push these load are pushing together in tension we're pulling apart we're pulling apart so if a spring is being compressed is it going to get larger or smaller its Dimensions its length if a spring is being compressed will it get smaller or larger wow I'm so glad you guys said smaller Okay so we've got the the the the terminology right now Force uh is applied to this in this case this load or p is applied to a a a rod of cross-sectional area a z and in this case we've got a load that's pulling these apart that's in tension so both of those um uh rods would be under stress one would be being compressed the other one would be being um stretched and the stress in both cases would be the load that we apply divided by the cross-sectional area strain is the defin defamation of the component um divided by its an original length now stresses can be sheare stresses where we're trying to chop something in half or they can be torsional stresses where we're trying to twist something um or it can be a tensile stress or a compressive stress as we saw before now we can't measure stress itself but we can measure deformation we can measure the change in cross-section so if we talk about normal stress normal stress is the force per unit area that's P divided by the cross-sectional area a and sigma is the stress in Newton per square meter so P must be in Newtons and area must be in square meters wow tough maths tough M now this cartoon um yeah is is going to be tensile stress here or compressive stress do you think this zebra is is undergoing we're pulling something off him pulling his stripes off is it tensile or compressive stress oh I think it's it's tense out stress okay all right and here we've got a picture of a lab and these are are are pieces of equipment called tensometer uh what they do is they they um uh allow us to put samples in between two jaws there's a lower jaw and an upper jaw there and then we apply a load and we stretch the the the the the tensile test object and we measure the load and the reduction in cross-sectional area and that helps us calculate the tensile strength of the material now I'm going to show you a sketch in a moment uh that explains um this this particular slide but when we talk about elastic elastic deformation and in Steels or in materials what elastic deformation means is is if we apply a a a load to a a piece of material and it stretches if we reduce or or or take away the load that piece uh of of of of Steel will go back to its original shape that's elastic Def deoration and um we're able to measure this um in the laboratory um doing tensile tests so if we want to find out the uh the the the tensile stress uh of a piece of material then we apply this formula what we know that Sigma is the stress e is Young's modulus of elasticity that's measured in gigap pascals and then e this Epsilon uh is the strain and the strain is dimensionless it's a change in in uh in length divided into the original length it's change so it's dimensionless and for different materials the the value of young Z modulus of elasticity capital E here can vary anywhere between 45 gigap pascals right up to 407 gigapascals it really depends on the material now here we've got a stress strain diagram and there's strain this is this is supposed to be little Epsilon you can see that it's the change in length divided by the original length that's why it's dimensionless and here's our stress that's load divided by cross-sectional area so if we look at this solid line of this curve this is a tensile test on a piece of material where we're measuring stress that we apply against strain that's the stretch of the material and here you can see a sample shape of a sample now in this region here where we've got a linear relationship between stress and strain this is called the limit uh of proportionality in other words stress is proportional to strain it's linear it's linear then we get to a point here that we call the elastic limit now in other words elastic limit is that stress applied to the material um that will when it's removed allow the material to go back to its original Dimension once we get above that limit that tensile stress limit we get what we call plastic deformation so in other words if I released the the stress if I released the load my tensile test object here would not go back to this original shape and what happens is we get something called necking and you can see we get a reduction in diameter of the tensile test sample and what's interesting is that here we get something called called the UTS the ultimate tensile strength once we get past that UTS Point look what happens here I don't have to apply any more load the material is saying oh goodbye I'm failing and then we get fracture of the the tensile test uh um uh sample and I just want to show you in a moment what those look like so the proportional limit is the stress at which the linear relationship between stress and fail uh and and strain fails to exist that is the limit of proportionality or proportional limit as they have on this slide here once you pass that point it's the point of no return now Engineers when they design whether it's a bridge whether it's a rope for for for uh uh uh a a drag um in a in a in a quarry they're always designing to make sure that we never ever stress a material past this point here because that can leads to failure now yield stress I've mentioned before that's where we get yielding of the material and then we get plastic deformation occurring strain Harding is is if you look at the sample you could see the the grain structure you know under a microscope you could see the grain structure of the materials actually starting to change um and that's what's doing the damage um let's talk about engineering uh uh material properties for a moment stiffness that's how much a component will deflect or not deflect uh under a given load um we've given stick material here diamond diamond does not change and uh very very heavy loads um rubber on the other hand it doesn't take much to change the shape of a piece of rubber so Diamond would have a very very high um young modulus of elasticity and rubber of course would have a very very low modulus of elasticity ductility that's defined really as the ability of a material to be drawn into wires strength the strength of a material is the ability of of that material to resist defamation now when we're talking about failure mechanisms Engineers when they're designing equipment have to take all of these five failure mechanisms into account when they're designing equipment well fracture is defined quite simply as a separation of a body into two or more pieces and let's hope if we design something that we never ever see fracture occurring now fracture can occur under uh conditions of compressive stress sheer stress and torsional stress and there's definitely two steps in the process that occurs before we have ultimately a fracture on our hands and that is the formation of cracks and then the propagation of cracks and we got two possible fraction modes there's fracture occurring under ductile conditions and Fracture occurring under brittle conditions now let me show you the samples of these tensile test objects that I was talking about before imagine those tensile uh uh test machines with tensometer um producing a load uh on on samples until they actually fracture um this would show you the difference samples um of different materials and the fractures that we get depending on the ductility of the of the um of the sample here we can see that we've got necking that's really really visible so in other words this material has stretched and stretched and stretched and then bang it's it's broken this is indicative of a very highly ductile uh material something like copper something like aluminium here we see there's been a definite reduction in the size of the sample up to the point of fracture then at the point of fracture now we can see this sore tooth pattern here where the the samples are torn apart um from each other so this is what we call a mod rutile fracture um you'd see that in um uh some um stainless steels for example and then on here on this particular one here we've got brittle fracture you can see no reduction in cross-section here and what happens is we load the sample it doesn't stretch we load the sample more it doesn't stretch we load the sample more it doesn't stretch and then what happens is we reach the ultimate tensile strength of the material with without it having stretched and then bang it just gives way and this is indicative of a um a highly brittle material any ideaas what that might be can you think of a highly brittle material highly brittle metal for example highly brittle metal yep well cast iron is a is is a very very common uh material that is very brittle tungsten you said is is is brittle as well titanium I think in titanium you're going to see this one is moderately dutile tining tining uh is is that highspeed steel yeah I think it's going to be it's going to be there um on the on the on the brittle fracture brass no you'll see some necking on the sample before it gives way so PR is is moderately ductile plus definitely brittle ever stret try to stretch a pane of glass I haven't but it would be interesting to see if you could now yeah glass is definitely brittle now with ductile uh fracture uh the process is we've get a very slow crack propagation if we reduce the load then the crack becomes stable and it's not a great situation to be in but we we we won't uh we won't get any any any fracture occurring unless we reapply the load and and carry on doing that until we get to a certain um stage where we've got plastic deformation where the material has visibly stretched and we know around the corner fractures just waiting to happen so that's that's ductile fracture with brittle fracture it's the other extreme what happens is you get very very little if any deoration at the fracture site and you know as I said before we apply a load keep on applying it keep on applying it and then bang it goes and it goes very very suddenly um you get rapid crack propagation and a brittle fracture is extremely quick and it can be very catastrophic other failures that we um uh can see in in construction are um Dynamic stresses um and and fluctuating stresses uh this is where the stresses are going up and down and the dynamic stresses are are going back and forth and what's happened here in this pretty little picture is this boat has broken in half it's broken in half due to fluctuating stresses um I'm glad I didn't design that here's some examples of fatigue uh we've got a truck with a a ladder on here and oh dear the ladder has broken and okay it's bent as well how about this is an example of fatigue we' got a jet aircraft engine where the uh the blades of the jet engine flew apart and it just burst the casing of the of the jet engine so these are things people that Engineers have to design out um so we've got to really be uh aware of these things um another um form of stress is corrosion now corrosion basically people is what can can somebody give me a a definition of corrosion but a very very simple one okay we've got some let's got some to me corrosion is is a a a a loss of material due to a chemical and electrical reaction so loss of material can be gradual or it can be rapid um but it's a loss of material and um if we lose material um then we lose strength now there are two types of corrosion that we're going to look at in this webinar that's uniform and low localized corrosion with uniform corrosion as the name implies it happens all over the all over the surface and basically um the uh the corrosion rate is the same over the surface of the material and things that can can affect um U corrosion uniform corrosion are low PH things that are very very acidic dissolved oxygen dissolved carbon diox dioxide and another one here is high temperatures high temperatures can accelerate corrosion and here's some examples of uniform corrosion you can see this this steel flow has been eaten away and you can see the corrosion there is uniform um I don't know who was standing there before that gave away but anyway you can see that that's that's that's happened here in this construction site and another example is where we've got a pillar in seawater and you can see where the where the high tide is here can't you okay there we've got a good example of uniform corrosion localized corrosion is where we've got nonuniform loss of material over the surface of of the component and things that affect that are carbon dioxide calcium chlorides especially in stainless Steels um that are are that contain um calcium chlorides and um that can can affect local corrosion and here we can see an example of localized corrosion this is so localized here that it's actually gone right through the material and there's some examples here on the right hand side here of uh localized corrosion um we've got something called here soic s o h i c does anybody know what soic is well the the letters s o h i c stand for stress oriented hydrogen induced cracking it's a funy name for uh what happens when we get hydrogen sulfide corrosion you know hydrogen sulfide this the stuff the that that smells like bad eggs if you've ever been in a Refinery you can smell it often um that's Sul s I'll say it in English hydrogen sulfide uh attacking uh weak points in the material here and galvanic corrosion can anybody give me an example of where galvanic corrosion occurs no hint but think the name might give it away where do you think galvanic corrosion occurs steel and aluminium yes that's for sure what else have I got aluminium and stainless steel bolt yes uh underwater and ships holes uh the propellers yes good example Bruce brilliant example you you you got what I was hinting out there galvanized steel people that's where it happens there so the the in in in galvanized steel for example the zinc which is the galvanizing sacrifices itself to protect the steel and we've got two dissimilar Metals in contact with with each other uh steel and copper and if we looked at the galvanic series The t um in the galvanic series we see that in natural fact zinc and steel are fairly close together if you looked at that same table and looked at Copper now copper could protect steel but steel and copper are further apart in the galvanic series and what will happen is if you copper plate steel and compare the life of its uh uh ability to protect the steel you'll find it shorter than the sink under the same conditions here we've got crevice corrosion um this is where we we get a concentration um uh where we've got it can be dissimilar materials um it can happen under the the heads of washers and I think someone gave me an example there of aluminium and steel uh steel bolts um definitely could get get that where you've got dissimilar metals and you've got some kind of electrolyte could be water it could be leaked product whatever you can also get it um in gaskets you get um steel gaskets that um can accelerate corrosion uh if they're not selected if the material is not selected uh properly and stress corrosion cracking sec well we see that in sulfuric acid T tanks where um the chlorides sorry in hydrochloric acid tanks that are made from stainless steel where the chlorides in the acid actually attack the steel where it's being stressed and um you know when the tank is being filled up uh it expands uh so the steel is being stressed it's it's being stretched and then when the tank empties then the steel is being compressed it's trying to get back to its original shape um springs for example um mechanical seal manufacturers to reduce the cost of of producing their mechanical seals often make the Springs out of stainless steel now that's fine if you are um using them on water that has very very low chloride content um but if you got anything that's got any significant amount of chlorides in what will happen is that spring will crack and it will fail and the mechanical seal will ultimately fail how about this example of fatigu corrosion what you got here is you got the presence of stress along with corrosion so the parts are are stressed cyclically and um you've got the add um devil of of corrosion so that accelerates they they they feed on each other and accelerate each other oh and that brings us to the end now you'll see there's a slide here of a roller assembly your assignment question asks you to show an assembled sectioned view of this roller assembly so I just wanted to explain what we're looking for in that question um because last time we run this Workshop uh a lot of people said we don't understand what you're looking for what we're looking for is you to do us a drawing of this assembly sectioned so imagine I took a hacka and I cut down the center of this roller along this axis and I cut right through there and then all the way down through there so I cut this whole assembly in half from top to bottom what we're looking for is what would the view look like with this thing sectioned with this thing cut in half are you all with me on that that one there is that is that clear people what we're looking for great well then good luck with that question um and glad you yeah yeah Justin it doesn't have to be done doesn't have to be done on computer um a handdrawn sketch as long as it's clear and it shows the components uh you can draw it by hand what we're looking for people is your uh you can you can draw it by C if you want um and when you say Bruce what format do you want to send just please explain that well it'll be it well it remember it'll be well you can do it in PDF you can do it on uh whatever remember it's going to go on your exam paper so um if you're going to do it um you might want to do it by hand um and then uh then scan it and bring it put it into your into your exam paper whatever whatever suits you at the end of the day what we're looking for is your understanding of what this assembly would look like if we cut it in half and we looked at it from the direction of letter A so you got one section it's all the way through there but don't forget it's one drawing it's one drawing but it's going to show different components sectionalized isn't it and that's the only H hint I'm going to give you on this the rest you're going to have to think through so it'll be one drawing showing a sectionalized view of this roller assembly um people the the I'm just the lecturer um the um uh assignments will be given to you by EIT um and you'll find them normally on Moodle you find them on noodle okay people um are there any questions on anything we've done in this module that you'd like to ask now um usually put my uh email address on the very very last slide um but for you guys that uh well actually you you'll get all of these slides on Moodle uh but if you want to make a note of my email address there anything that you want to ask me um apart from the answers to the to the the assignments um you're more than welcome I'll try and and get back to you I am away from Saturday um I'm being sent to Marius on business people on business um so I won't be able to answer anything until the week after next there must be an easier way to there we go there's my email address in yeah you're right guys that's a tough job but somebody's got to do it so may as well be me so people once more Daniel no I don't want to delegate um once more people any questions on anything we've done in this webinar oh you're very welcome Maria very welcome okay Scott go well okay Daniel you're welcome you're welcome Sarah okay Colin we you're very welcome Justin you to Tom glad you enjoyed it Justin okay guys cheers all the best and when the weekend comes have a good one okay folks as I say anything that you might have an afterthought on there's the email address this should be on the slides in Moodle for you so from me then cherio guys all the best and we see you I believe it's on the 4th of March four of March so until then stay well and it's goodbye for me"

        "transcription": "Mechanical engineers have changed the world. You could even say: the course of history. Not just once but countless times. Because they‚Äôve identified problems that were\nholding humanity back, and they solved them. Things were too big and heavy to move.\nTravel was too difficult. Distances too far.\nOur bodies were too weak. If you can think of an invention that\nrevolutionized the way people live, odds are\nit was created by mechanical engineers. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being biased. Theirs is the field of engineering that focuses\non the design, construction, operation, and\nmaintenance of machines and mechanical systems\n‚Äì pretty much anything that moves. And since the beginning, mechanical engineering\nhas faced a great many challenges, and solved\na lot of problems. The examples are too many to count, but consider\nthings like the steam engine, airplanes, robots, and\nbiomechanical suits. The engineers behind all of these devices\nwere able to find solutions to big problems. And of course, they faced difficulties along\nthe way. But great efforts almost always do. [Theme Music] Back in the day, if you wanted to get somewhere,\nyou would have had two options: your own two\nfeet or a horse. And if you wanted to take a heavy load with\nyou, you needed a carriage. Wheels. The invention of the wheel is one of the oldest roots\nof mechanical engineering, along with all of the simple\ntools that went into building the carriage itself. If we include the simple levers that were used to\nopen gates and bring down bridges, we‚Äôd have a great,\nbut primitive, base of early mechanical engineering. But horse-drawn carriages aren‚Äôt very fast. A horse needs rest and food, so it would be generous\nto say you could cover 80 kilometers a day. This gave the engineers of the past a problem. As the world opened up, it became more\nimportant to cover distances in less time,\nand horses just weren't cutting it. They needed something faster. They needed an engine. Making its first appearance in the early 18th century,\nthe steam engine marked a major turning point in the\ndevelopment of modern mechanical engineering. It was proposed that a steam engine could\ndo the work of ten, fifteen, or even twenty horses! And you wouldn‚Äôt need to bother with any\nhay...or manure. This brings us to Thomas Newcomen, the British\ninventor who developed the first successful steam\nengine with a piston in 1712. In his design, atmospheric pressure pushed\nthe piston down, after the condensation of steam\nhad created a vacuum in the cylinder. Its original use was to draw water out of the\nCornish tin mines, after Newcomen found how\nexpensive it was to use horses to pump the water. Then along came the Scottish inventor James\nWatt. In 1763, while repairing one of Newcomen‚Äôs engines, Watt realized that about three quarters of the\nenergy from the steam was going to waste, used\nonly to heat the chamber of the engine. His solution was to have a separate condenser. The steam would then be condensed in a\nchamber separate from the piston chamber, so that\nthe condensed steam didn't go to waste. Keeping the two processes separate allowed\nfor continued rotary motion, which was really\nimportant, because it allowed for a more consistent\nsource of power. Watt‚Äôs invention came to be widely used\nto run machines in the factories that drove\nthe Industrial Revolution. Watt went on to be the first engineer to be\ncommemorated in Westminster Abbey, with a large,\nwhite marble statue erected in his memory. He also had his last name recognized as a\nunit of power, which is perhaps one of the\nhighest honors that an engineer can get. But steam engines really came into their own,\nespecially in the realm of transportation, in the\nlocomotives of the 19th century. George and Robert Stephenson, an English father-son\nduo, are famous for their early steam locomotive, which\nthey called, aptly enough, ‚ÄúLocomotion.‚Äù In 1825, it became the first public passenger train,\ncarrying 450 people at 24 kilometers per hour. Quite a bit faster than a horse! But while wheeled vehicles allowed people to travel\nmore quickly on land, transportation was still limited\nby bodies of water and rough, mountainous terrain. If engineers could figure out a way to get\npeople to fly, all of that could be avoided! This problem-solving led to the invention\nof aircraft. The first powered aircraft to take flight was the Wright\nFlyer in 1903, which was designed by Wilbur and Orville\nWright and used a 12-horsepower gas engine. Orville flew the Wright Flyer on its maiden\nvoyage, traveling 36 meters in 12 seconds. But the best flight of the day belonged to Wilbur,\nwho traveled over 255 meters in 59 seconds, or a speed of about 15 kilometers an hour,\nearning him some serious bragging rights. Soon after the Wright brothers‚Äô accomplishment,\nWorld War I sparked a burst of aircraft innovation. Engineers began using metal in the structures\nof the airplanes, and better engines, allowing\nthem to reach higher speeds and altitudes. Then, in 1930, Sir Frank Whittle obtained\nhis first patent for a turbo-jet engine. But it wasn‚Äôt until the outbreak of World War II\nthat the British government had a compelling\nreason to support his work. By 1941, Whittle‚Äôs engine featured a multistage\ncompressor, a combustion chamber, a single turbine,\nand a nozzle ‚Äì which was a big improvement, since previous\nengine designs only had an internal-combustion\nengine and a propeller. Jet engines outperformed the older designs,\nflying farther, faster, and cheaper too. These advances ultimately made commercial\nair travel possible, and soon people were traveling\nwhere once only the birds had ruled. But mechanical engineering doesn‚Äôt stop\nin the air! Beyond planes, we‚Äôve sent satellites into\norbit, astronauts to the moon, and spacecraft\ncarrying rovers all the way to Mars. The aerospace side of engineering actually\narose from the mechanical field. And much of what has allowed us to build these\nmachines that move us is another big part of the\nmechanical engineering field: robotics. For most of industrial history, humans have\nbeen at the center of our workforce. But humans have their limits. Some things are too big and too awkward to\nmove, while other processes needed a finer\nprecision than the human hand allows. Industrial environments are also often uncomfortable\nand sometimes even dangerous. And that‚Äôs where robots and automation come in. The first industrial robot, called Unimate,\nappeared around 1960. It was designed by American inventor George\nDevol, Jr., who worked with engineer and entrepreneur\nJoseph Engelberger to get it into factories. Unimate robots had up to six fully programmable\naxes of motion and could handle parts weighing\nup to around 225 kilograms at high speeds. They soon joined the assembly line at a General\nMotors plant, where they took die castings from\nmachines and welded them onto auto bodies. Since then, robots have gone beyond manufacturing,\nshowing up in our homes to clean the floors, and\neven hospitals to perform surgeries. But as their applications get more advanced,\nengineers have more and more factors to consider. They need to worry about how well robots sense\ntheir surroundings, how they move and manipulate\ntheir environments, and much more. It‚Äôs possible one day that we‚Äôll have\nrobots in many of the places you could\nimagine a human working. I mean, we‚Äôre seeing that now. And speaking of humans, you can think of the human\nbody as just a super complex mechanical system of\nits own, made of links and connecting joints. And this is where biomechanics comes in. Engineers need to take into account the stress,\nload, and impact that our bodies can withstand,\nand apply it to machines that are modeled on us. Advanced biomechanics is one of the newest\ndivisions of mechanical engineering. From it, we‚Äôre already seeing the beginnings of\nexoskeleton-suits, limbs that move like their biological\ncounterparts, and other robotic implants. One of the more impressive projects is the\nBerkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton. Funded by the Defense Advanced Research\nProject Agency in 2000, this device is designed to provide mechanical\nsupport to allow nearly anyone to carry larger, heavier\nloads than they could ever lift on their own. The ability to carry heavy loads is often a problem\nfor soldiers and disaster relief workers, so finding\na solution to this is pretty important. But the problems are many. For one thing, power sources for exo-suits\nare often too heavy or cumbersome. But the BLEEX, as it‚Äôs called, overcomes\nthis by using a small hybrid power source that delivers hydraulic power for the suit‚Äôs\nlocomotion and electrical power for its computer. The first prototype was recently introduced,\nconsisting of two powered, anthropomorphic legs,\na power unit, and a backpack-like frame. Using the frame, a person can carry a heavy\nload, but only have it feel like a few pounds. In similar fashion, Berkeley is also behind the\nAustin project, which aims to develop exoskeleton\nsystems for people with mobility disorders. So it‚Äôs almost as if we‚Äôve gone full circle,\nfrom the inventors who developed the first\nsteam engine to replace the horse, to the biomechanical engineers who are\nusing robotics to simulate the most basic\nmeans of transportation: walking. Those are some of the very big problems that\nmechanical engineers have managed to solve. And when it comes to the problems that we\nstill face today ‚Äì from driving in traffic to getting\nfood and water to remote areas ‚Äì you can bet that mechanical engineers\nwill be there to tackle them. So today we learned all about many different\nareas of mechanical engineering, beginning\nwith the steam engine. We then moved on to aircraft and the work\nbehind them. And we finished by going into the more modern\nareas of robotics and biomechanics. In the next episode we‚Äôll explore electrical\nengineering, its history, and the work that\nelectrical engineers do. Thanks for watching and I‚Äôll see you then. Crash Course Engineering is produced in association\nwith PBS Digital Studios. You can head over to their channel to check\nout a playlist of their latest amazing shows, like PBS Space Time, Above the Noise, and\nPhysics Girl.

        "transcription": "what is a circuit and how does it¬†\neven work how does electricity work¬†¬† all right so the the one thing that is the most¬†\nhelpful to understand is that electricity needs¬†¬† to make a loop we have a complete Loop this is¬†\na circuit so say we have a Transformer out here¬†¬† on a pole somewhere that is just a single¬†\npiece of wire going through it at one end¬†¬† to have the start of our Loop and then say¬†\nwe have like a light bulb on the other end¬†¬† it's another loop so from the bottom you know¬†\nlike a little part of the bulb to the screw¬†¬† shell this is probably going to be connected¬†\non one side and this is going to connect on¬†¬† the other side but essentially what you have on¬†\nthe inside is just a light filament that touches¬†¬† one side of that bulb and the other side of¬†\nthat bulb so you have a coil of one wire on¬†¬† the other end you have a coil of one wire and¬†\nin between them we run two wires one to each¬†¬† one that's it that's a complete circuit that's¬†\na loop that's how current travels if you break¬†¬† this Loop and and like pull it apart current can't¬†\ntravel through here there's no flow the only way¬†¬† current can travel and electricity has any kind of¬†\nelectromotive force is if you have a complete Loop¬†¬† once you connect a switch you complete the loop¬†\nlight bulb turns on once you flip the switch off¬†¬† switch opens no more current flow so that is how¬†\nelectrical Works essentially but there's a couple¬†¬† of quantities that we want to think about so when¬†\nwe talk about electrical terms we're always using¬†¬† volts amps ohms and Watts you might not use Watts¬†\nyou might use like volt amps if you're talking¬†¬† about like reactive power you're talking about¬†\nstorage like instead of energy being consumed¬†¬† you're talking about energy being stored you might¬†\ntalk about capacitance like there's some other¬†¬† capacitive reactants and inductive reactants and¬†\nthings like that you can learn about that stuff¬†¬† later because that's just kind of like extra¬†\ndetails into a circuit that are not necessary¬†¬† to really understand electrical at a base¬†\nfundamental level so what we have is volts volts¬†¬† equals pressure how much pressure are we putting¬†\nout on the primary side of our circuit from our¬†¬† source there's a generator spinning somewhere¬†\nit might be Niagara Falls there's water falling¬†¬† and it's making something spin because they're¬†\nutilizing that water to spin something and that's¬†¬† how you get a certain amount of pressure through¬†\nthe system and if you create more motion or if you¬†¬† change the Dynamics of the magnetism inside or¬†\nor any of that there's different ways in which¬†¬† you can get more or less pressure you can have a¬†\nsmaller thing spinning or a bigger thing spinning¬†¬† so you're going to get different pressure or a¬†\ndifferent voltage from whatever is generating¬†¬† and spinning and making that movement possible so¬†\nover here we've got a spinning let's just do like¬†¬† a little thing like this like say we have like a¬†\nfan spinning fan spinning over here and uh from¬†¬† that fan spinning we're getting a a pressure that¬†\nis delivered to our circuit so that's voltage we¬†¬† might test 12 volts between here we might test¬†\n125 volts we might test 480 or 10 150 000 whole¬†¬† bunch of different voltages but all we're talking¬†\nabout with voltage is how much pressure is there¬†¬† in the system 12 volt systems with like low¬†\nvoltage lighting on the grass very very low¬†¬† pressure not very much pressure at all and if you¬†\nadd too many loads on a system you could actually¬†¬† drop voltage or drop pressure over the entirety of¬†\nthat circuit to the point where at the end of it¬†¬† nothing will light up anymore because there's¬†\nnot enough pressure to make it through the¬†¬† amount of resistance that's inside of that thing¬†\nthere's just too much opposition to the pressure¬†¬† so nothing's going to move it's like a bunch of¬†\npeople in the crowd right like you try to get¬†¬† everybody to move but at a certain point there's¬†\nlike a saturation where the pressure being applied¬†¬† by all the people in the back and the resistance¬†\nfrom the people on this side like nothing's Moving¬†¬† And so there's no byproduct of that there's¬†\nno actual movement or flow to create anything¬†¬† so that is the way that we think about voltage¬†\nvoltage is often called a difference of potential¬†¬† because on one side you have what we can think¬†\nof as like a negative potential and the other¬†¬† side you're going to have what's considered¬†\na positive potential one of them is pushing¬†¬† while the other one is pulling at equal force¬†\nand at the exact same time so when we have that¬†¬† spinning going on that's in a generator back at¬†\na power plant there's two wires that come off of¬†¬† that generator and one of them while this magnet¬†\nis spinning inside of it is has a pushing motion¬†¬† but at the same time since it's spinning while¬†\nthat one is pushing the other one's pulling so¬†¬† you can kind of think of this back and forth¬†\nthat's happening between these two wires and¬†¬† with alternating current it's alternating it's¬†\ngoing back and forth 60 times a second so it¬†¬† kind of it's like this fast like vibration that's¬†\nhappening much faster than that by the way so it's¬†¬† almost like a constant we almost experience it¬†\nas a constant we don't see a light bulb or load¬†¬† on this side blinking but if we captured the light¬†\nbulb with a camera and sat and watched and slowed¬†¬† everything down you would see this light bulb is¬†\nblinking but because our eyes only you know like¬†¬† we observe reality at a certain frame rate so to¬†\nus it actually as fast as our brains and our eyes¬†¬† can process it looks like it's just a solid thing¬†\nyou can increase frequency and you can make things¬†¬† blink even faster there's a lot of different¬†\nagain that's just another like angle that we¬†¬† could look into a basic circuit but that's adding¬†\ncomplexity that we don't need to really add right¬†¬† now but there's a certain amount that a load¬†\nis essentially blinking because it's shifting¬†¬† back and forth Push Pull Push Pull voltage is¬†\nthe amount of pressure that we apply what we're¬†¬† actually pushing with that pressure is called¬†\ncurrent and we say amperes are for the flow¬†¬† how much flow of charge is going through this¬†\nyou can kind of think of it like a whole bunch¬†¬† of little BBS if we added up pressure to one¬†\nside and this is just like a tube full of BBS¬†¬† all those BBS are going to start moving well¬†\neach one of the BBS how many BBS move percent¬†¬† second it's a rate amperage is the same thing¬†\nhow much flow is happening per second so a lot¬†¬† of current means that there's a lot of charges¬†\nmoving per second very little current you like one¬†¬† amp is very few charges moving per second so just¬†\nremember it's a raid at how much flow it's like¬†¬† uh in plumbing you might have liters per minute or¬†\nliters per second it's how much water is actually¬†¬† flowing through this complete Loop this complete¬†\nenclosed system so a lot of times people use water¬†¬† as an analogy to understand what's happening¬†\nin electrical currents and for the most part¬†¬† it's a pretty accurate thing some of it is not¬†\n100 but you can kind of conceptualize water in¬†¬† wires sorta so that is flow if we wanted to take¬†\nan ammeter and say we connected like a 240 volts¬†¬† to some wires and we had a load that over here¬†\nthat's like a you know again like a light bulb¬†¬† we could actually take an ammeter and the¬†\nammeter is going to or a clamp on ammeter is¬†¬† going to sense how strong of a magnetic pulse¬†\nis happening around these conductors because¬†¬† there's an expanding and collapsing magnetic¬†\nfield remember this is a pulsing system so¬†¬† it's going to detect how much current is flowing¬†\nthrough because the more current the stronger that¬†¬† that pulsing is going to be it's not going to¬†\nchange like how many times it's blinking it's¬†¬† still blinking at a solid rate at 60 hertz or it's¬†\nyou know 60 times per second in our situation but¬†¬† it's going to be pulsing stronger at 60 times a¬†\nsecond so it's going to detect that there's much¬†¬† more current flowing through because it's just¬†\nquantity of charges or quantity of BBS flowing¬†¬† through so that is amperage it's it's there's¬†\nthere's copper and copper is made of atoms and¬†¬† atoms have electrons and when you influence an¬†\nelectrical field around a particle that field¬†¬† can push that particle and so the moving back¬†\nand forth in an AC circuit just detects that¬†¬† movement so that's amps when you're talking¬†\nabout amperage we don't send amps to stuff we¬†¬† apply pressure we connect at the other end a load¬†\nand a load has a certain amount of resistance to¬†¬† it and if we don't have any resistance and we just¬†\ntake like another wire and connect them a whole¬†¬† crap load of current is going to flow current is¬†\nalways trying to flow at its maximum so electrical¬†¬† current is always trying to like basically travel¬†\nthe speed of light and it's our responsibility as¬†¬† electricians to try to slow electricity down so¬†\nthat we can actually utilize it for something¬†¬† useful so a light bulb the use that we get out¬†\nof it is that we want light so what we do is we¬†¬† figure out how much resistance do we need to¬†\nput inside of this bulb like what do we need¬†¬† to do to the conductor to make sure it has enough¬†\nresistance so that when we hook it up to the black¬†¬† and the light it doesn't explode but instead¬†\nit just starts to glow red hot or yellow hot¬†¬† and now we have a wanted effect there's a little¬†\nbit of heat loss that happens you can kind of¬†¬† feel that that energy that's being applied is¬†\nescaping in heat but it's also escaping in life¬†¬† so the escaping that's happening the reaction from¬†\napplying a resistance to a pressure or a voltage¬†¬† is that it gives off something and that something¬†\nis what we call wattage so wattage is uh power¬†¬† consumption it's kind of a wanted effect it's¬†\nit's energy escaping something so a toaster we¬†¬† love wattage in a toaster right because it gives¬†\noff heat and we're trying to use that heat to heat¬†¬† up bread and toast it so we create another kind¬†\nof little wrapped up coil of wire that we call a¬†¬† heating element and we hook that heating element¬†\nthrough a cord to the black and the white we just¬†¬† hook it up and we allow current to flow through¬†\nand it doesn't like it's not explosive because¬†¬† the amount of resistance that are in those¬†\nelements is so much and you could add more¬†¬† elements and make it even crazy but then there¬†\nwouldn't be as much heat there's just too much¬†¬† opposition there's too much resistance so those¬†\nare our last two values we have ohms which is¬†¬† always our opposition again in the crowd of people¬†\nyou're applying pressure you get a whole bunch of¬†¬† resistance on one side you're not going to get¬†\nthe whole thing to move you're going to have a¬†¬† stoppage that happens so there's a certain point¬†\nwhere you can have so much resistance in something¬†¬† that current can't flow through it so if you¬†\nlessen the amount of resistance more current¬†¬† can start to flow and if there's no resistance or¬†\nvery very little it's going to flow like crazy so¬†¬† controlling the resistance everything that we hook¬†\nin every electrical device every microwave fridge¬†¬† every vacuum cleaner that we plug in TV router¬†\ncharging your phone everything we're basically¬†¬† just taking a certain amount of resistance and¬†\nintroducing it into a circuit that has pressure¬†¬† and we're allowing a certain amount of current to¬†\nflow and if you maybe like hook up your phone to¬†¬† the wrong charger maybe the resistance inside of¬†\nthat charging block is not set up for your phone¬†¬† so you could allow too much current to flow¬†\nthrough that thing and you could destroy your¬†¬† phone so you start to understand like oh it's it's¬†\nall about resistance every load everything that we¬†¬† say we're hooking a load up a light bulb would be¬†\na load or a motor would be a load we're hooking a¬†¬† certain amount of resistance to a circuit where¬†\nimpedance to allow current to go through it at¬†¬† whatever level it is designed to have current¬†\ngo through it light bulbs will blow up if you¬†¬† hook 240 volts to them if they're only rated for¬†\n120 volts somebody sat in an engineer calculated¬†¬† all right if we put a pressure of 120 volts and we¬†\ntake a resistance of like who knows I don't know¬†¬† 5 ohms or something how much current is going¬†\nto be drawn through that circuit and through¬†¬† that bulb and it can handle it or is it going to¬†\nexplode or is it not going to be is it going to¬†¬† be too much resistance where it's not going to¬†\nmatter the pressure is not going to allow that¬†¬† current to actually flow because we have too¬†\nmuch resistance against it that's it that's¬†¬† electrical that's the whole of everything you need¬†\nto understand watts is what happens to the load as¬†¬† a result of introducing that load to a pressure so¬†\nwe introduced say 100 watt light bulb well we know¬†¬† that 100 watts of power is going to be consumed or¬†\nyou can kind of think of it as like lost there's a¬†¬† difference between power consumption and power¬†\nloss and in loads that are not like resistive¬†¬† loads that don't just have like a wire in them¬†\nyou could have things called reactants you could¬†¬† have things called capacitance inductance there's¬†\na lot of other values again the deeper you get in¬†¬† your career where you start wanting to evaluate¬†\nthings on a little bit deeper level to figure out¬†¬† what's going on that's when you should start¬†\nlooking into things like inductive reactants¬†¬† capacitive reactants and understanding how they¬†\naffect things and knowing the difference between¬†¬† reactive power knowing the difference between like¬†\npower factor and and what is wattage versus KVA¬†¬† like volt amps or thousands of volt amps because¬†\nVA and wattage are very similar they're almost¬†¬† like a one-to-one thing but there's a different¬†\nreason when you're talking about energy storage¬†¬† versus expending energy a toaster is expending¬†\nenergy a lot bulb is expending energy as light in¬†¬† this heat that sometimes we have storage systems¬†\nwe have capacitors and things like that that we¬†¬† want to maintain storage of that power and so¬†\nwe look at that as VA or volt amps instead of¬†¬† thinking about it as wattage so they're slightly¬†\ndifferent but again you don't need to know any of¬†¬† that that's just crazy stuff that if you start¬†\ngetting like super nerdy and you just want to¬†¬† watch more videos and and read books that's stuff¬†\nto look into when you get to that point but just¬†¬† understand the entirety of what you do every day¬†\nis there's a house in between here right and in¬†¬† that house we're putting these little loads and¬†\noutside out the street there's a Transformer and¬†¬† we're just creating a whole Loop through the house¬†\nevery single load that you hook up creates a loop¬†¬† and when that Loop is created current is able¬†\nto travel and you have to unplug it or turn a¬†¬† switch off to get it to stop traveling but each¬†\nindividual load that you plug in has a different¬†¬† amount of resistance inside of it that is going to¬†\nallow current to flow differently so some things¬†¬† that you plug in only like 10 amps are going to¬†\nflow some things you plug in 60 amps are going to¬†¬† flow because of the amount of resistance inside¬†\nof that that they want to allow current to flow¬†¬† through because they want this thing to have a¬†\ncertain amount of wattage or a reaction that is¬†¬† useful to us so that's it that's the whole shebang¬†\nhope that helped share it with your teachers share¬†¬† it with your classmates share it with your buddy¬†\ndriving down the street well not if he's the one¬†¬† driving I guess if you're driving neither one¬†\nof you should be sharing things while you're¬†¬† driving but I hope this helps some of you all¬†\nunderstand conceptually the entire system of how a¬†¬† circuit works and can help you in your electrical¬†\nnerdum love you crazy people see in the next one"

        "transcription": "Hey there, guys, Paul here from theengineeringmindset.com. In this video, we are going to be looking at how electricity works. Now, this is pretty essential knowledge for any engineering, so we'll\nrun through the basic parts of what you need to know. So let's start at the very basics and for that, we need to\ntake a look at the atom. Everything, including\nyou, is made from atoms. All the materials we\nuse are made from atoms. The materials are just different because the construction of their atoms are slightly different. The atoms are made from three particles, two of which are found inside the nucleus and the third particle sits outside this. At the center of the\natom, we have the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, we have the neutrons, which have no charge, and\nwe also have the protons, which are positively charged. The neutrons and the\nprotons are much heavier than the electrons so these\nwill stay within the nucleus. Surround the nucleus are different\nlayers of orbital shells. These are like flight\npaths for the electrons. The electrons flow\nalong these flight paths much like a satellite orbits our plant, except that the electrons travel at almost the speed of light. The electrons are negatively charged and they are attracted\nto the positive charge of the protons. The electrons orbit around the nucleus in these orbital shells\nand there are a set numbers of how many electrons can\nbe in any one orbital shell. The number of protons, neutrons,\nand electrons an atom has tells us which material it is. Atoms hold on to their\nelectrons very tightly, but some materials will\nhold on to them more tightly than others. The outer-most shell is\nknown as the valence shell, and in this shell, some materials have\nloosely bound electrons which can flow to other atoms. Atoms which can pass electrons\nare called conductors and most metals are conductors. On the other hand, atoms which\ndo not have free electrons and so they can't pass\nelectrons between other atoms are known as insulators. And these are things\nlike glass and rubber. Now, we can combine these materials to safely use electricity by having the conductor in the center, which allows electrons to move, but surround this with an insulator to restrict where they can flow to, i.e., not lead to us, which keeps us safe. If we look inside a slice of copper cable at the free electrons\nsurrounding the nucleus of the copper atom, you'll\nsee that the free electrons are able to move to other atoms, but this happens randomly\nin any direction. If we then connect this\nslice of copper cable to a closed circuit with a power source, such as a battery, then the\nvoltage will force the electrons to move and these will then all flow in the same direction to try and get back to the other terminal of the battery. When I say circuit,\nthis just means the root which electrons could flow along between the two terminals,\nthe positive and the negative, of a power source. So we can add things into their path, like light bulbs, and this\nmeans that the electrons will have to pass through\nthis in order to get to the other terminal. And so we can use this to\ncreate things such as light. The circuit can either be open or closed. In a closed circuit,\nthat means the electrons can flow around. And in an open circuit, this\nmeans that the electrons are not able to flow. Voltage is a pushing force of\nelectrons within a circuit. It's like pressure in a water pipe. The more pressure you have,\nthe more water can flow. The more voltage you have,\nthe more electrons can flow. But what does a volt mean? Well, a volt is a joule per coulomb. And a joule is a measurement\nof energy or work and a coulomb is a group\nof flowing electrons. We'll have a look at what a coulomb is in just a second though. So a nine volt battery\ncan provide nine joules of energy in the form of work or heat per group of electrons that flow from one side of the battery to the other. In this case, the current of electrons flow from one side of the battery through the LED light\nbulb, which produces light, and then the electrons\nflow to the other side of the battery, therefore,\nnine joules of light and heat is produced by the light bulb. Current is the flow of electrons. When a circuit is closed, it means electrons can flow,\nand when the circuit is open, no electrons will flow. We can measure the flow of electrons just like you can measure the\nflow of water through a pipe. To measure the flow of electrons, we use the unit of amp. One amp means one coulomb per second and one coulomb is a group of electrons. The group is incredibly\nlarge and is approximately six billion, 242 million,\nbillion electrons, and that has to pass in one second for it to equal one amp. That's why electrons are grouped together and just called amps, to\nmake it easier for engineers. Resistance is a restriction\nto the flow of electrons in a circuit. The wire which carries the electrons will naturally have some resistance. The longer the wire, the\ngreater the resistance. The thicker the wire,\nthe lower the resistance. Resistance to the flow of electrons is different for each material. And the temperature of the material can also change resistance\nto the flow of electrons. Electrical circuits use\nspecially designed components known as resistors to\npurposely restrict the flow of electrons. This is either to protect other components from too many electrons flowing through it or it can also be used\nto create light and heat, such as in an incandescent light bulb. Resistance occurs when\nelectrons collide with atoms. The amount of collisions is\ndifferent from one material to another. Copper has very low collision rate, but other materials such as iron will have much more collisions. When collisions occur,\nthe atoms generate heat and at a certain temperature, the material will then\nstart to produce light as well as heat, which is how\nthe incandescent lamps work. When a wire is wrapped in a coil, it will generate a magnetic field as the current passes through it. The cable will naturally\ncreate electromagnetic field by itself. It's just intensified by the coil. By wrapping it in a coil, the magnetic field becomes so strong that the magnetic field starts to actually affect the electrons within the wire. But we'll look at why this occurs in a future, more advanced video. We can increase the strength\nof the magnetic field simply by wrapping the\ncoils around an iron core. We can also increase the number\nof turns within the coils and also we can increase\nthe amount of current passing through the circuit. And this is how electromagnets work and it's also the base of\nhow induction motors work. If you want to learn more\nabout induction motors, we've already covered this\nin another video already. Just see the link on the screen now. And when a magnetic field\npasses across the coil of wire, it will induce a voltage in that wire caused by an induced electromotive force, which is pushing electrons\nin a certain direction. If the wire is connected in a circuit, then this electromotive force\nwill cause a current to flow. This is the basis of\nhow AC generators work and the electricity at your\nwall sockets within your home is produced in a very similar way. Transformer, now, we can\ncombine all of the aspects together that we've just covered and when we do so, we will\nsee that we can use one coil to generate electricity and then we can place two other coils in very close proximity to\neach other but not touching, and this will create a transformer. The transformer will induce a voltage from the first of the primary coil over into the secondary coil. And this will force electrons to flow if the coil in the secondary side has a closed circuit. Now what's important about the transformer is that we can increase\nor decrease the voltage between the primary\nand the secondary coils simply by changing the amount\nof coils on either side. Again, this is a subject all by itself so we'll cover this in a\nmore advanced video later on. Now, something else which I\njust want to briefly mention is the capacitor. So, a capacitor forces\npositive and negative charges to separate across two plates when it is connected to a power supply. This causes a build-up\nor store of electrons within an electric field. When the power supply\nis cut or interrupted, these charges will then be released, flow up, and meet again. This provides a power source\nbut only for a few seconds until the charges have\npaired back up again. It's slightly similar to a battery, but capacitors are very common and they're in almost\nevery single circuit board. We'll cover this obviously in more detail in a future video. Just be aware of these. So the last part I want\nto cover in this video is that there are two types\nof current electricity. That being alternating current, or AC, and then direct current, or DC. Alternating current simply means that the current flows\nbackwards and forwards in a circuit as the terminals\nare constantly reversed. This is a bit like the tide of the sea. It goes in and out, in\nand out, in and out. So there is reversing constantly. Now, alternating current\nis the most common source of power and the plug\nsockets in your homes, in your buildings, in schools,\nand work places, et cetera, these will all be providing\nalternating current, AC. Now, on the other hand, we've\ngot direct current, or DC, and that simply means\nthat the current flows directly in only one direction. It is not alternating. This is what's provided from batteries and almost all your handheld devices are from this, as well. So we can convert AC to DC and vice versa using power electronics. And this is how we charge and power, you know, small devices, and it's also how solar panels can be used to power our homes. Because solar panels produce DC power and our homes need AC power. So we have to convert\nthis for it to be usable. So both AC and DC have\npros and cons to it, but, you know, for sure we'll look at this in another later video. It's a bit more advanced. And there's also quite\nan interesting history behind why we use AC, DC, and\nthe inventors behind that. If you've got 10 minutes,\nI definitely recommend having a Google or a YouTube of this, too. All right, that's it for this video. Thank you very much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this and it helped you. If you have any questions, please leave me in the\ncomments section below.

        "transcription": "[animation of electrons flowing from a \nbattery to light bulb in a loop]\nLet's begin by looking at how a simple circuit allows a light bulb to light. A circuit is a route through which electrical\ncurrent can flow. In our example, [arrow pointing to the negative side of the battery]\nelectrons flow from the negative side of a\nD-cell battery [arrow pointing to the metal base of the light bulb]\nto a conducting material on the base of the\nbulb. From there, [the arrow moves pointing out the electron's path]\nthe electrons flow up a wire that is inside\nthe bulb and across the filament, which is the part of the bulb that actually\nlights. When the electrons go through the filament, some of the electrical energy is changed to\nheat and light energy. The electrons continue down another small\nwire inside the bulb to another conductor on the base of the bulb. [arrow pointing to the positive end of the battery]\nThe electrons finally make their way to the positive side of the battery. There would not be a complete circuit if the\nelectrons did not travel to the positive side of the battery, and the bulb would not light. When there is an unbroken path on which electrons\nflow, [the title complete circuit appears]\nas in this example, it is called a complete\ncircuit. The unbroken path that the electrons follow is called a closed circuit. Because electricity will only flow on an unbroken\npath, the light bulb will not light unless there\nis a closed circuit. Now look closely at the light bulb [image zooms into closer to the light bulb]\nand you'll notice that there is an insulator\nbetween the conductor that leads up to the filament and the conductor that leads away from the filament. Remember that the atoms of conductors easily accept and pass on electrons; the atoms of insulators do not. As we discussed in the first section of the\nlesson, [image fades to reveal a wire with\ninsulation with a break in the insulation]\nelectrons will not easily pass through\ninsulating material that surrounds a wire. If an insulator did not surround a wire carrying a current, it is possible for the electron flow [a paperclip touching the uninsulated part of the wire]\nto get directed to another conductor that comes into contact with the circuit. [a hand moves in to touch the paperclip,\nelectron flow into the hand]\nElectricity will follow the\npath of least resistance. If the electrons take a path\nshort of  the complete circuit, [the title Short Circuit appears]\nit is called a short circuit."

        "transcription": "Hey there guys. Paul here from TheEngineeringMindset.com. In this video, we're going to\nbe looking at the difference between the hot, neutral and ground wires as well as the function of\neach with some worked examples. This video is for homes in North America. If you are outside this region then you can still follow along\nbut your system will work and look a bit different, so\ndo check out our other videos. Remember, electricity is\ndangerous and can be fatal. You should be qualified and competent to carry out any electrical work. Before we get into this video, there are three things\nI need you to remember. Number one, electricity will only flow in a complete circuit. If you come into contact\nwith an electrical conductor, your body might complete the circuit. Number two is that\nelectricity always tries to return to its source and number three, electricity will take all available paths to complete a circuit but\nit will take preference to a path with less\nresistance and so more current is going to flow in that path. So we're going to be looking at the hot, neutral and ground wires for a typical North American\nresidential electrical circuit. First we'll see a really simple circuit to understand how it works, then we're going to apply this knowledge to a complex residential installation. When we look at a simple\nelectrical circuit with just a battery and a lamp, we know that to turn the lamp on we need to connect both ends of the wires to the terminals of the battery. Once we connect these wires, the circuit is now complete\nand electrons can flow from the negative through the lamp and then back to the positive terminal. So for the circuit to be complete, we need a wire to carry the\nelectrons from the power supply and over to the light. This wire is our hot wire, then we need to connect\nanother wire from the lamp and back to the battery for the electrons to get back to their power\nsupply or from their source, and this wire is our neutral wire. The hot wire carries electricity\nfrom the power supply and then will take this over to the load. The neutral wire carries\nthe used electricity back to the power supply. If we look at a residential\nelectrical system in North America, then we\nwill find two hot wires a neutral wire and some ground wires. If you want to see in\ndetail how this all works then check out our video for that, links in the video description below. Now, imagine for a second,\nthe homes electrical system is connected to a battery\nand we have just one hot wire and a neutral wire. And as we saw with the simple circuit, for the light to turn\non, we need a hot wire to the supply of the current to the load and we need the neutral wire to return the current to the source. Electricity therefore\nflows through the hot, through the busbar and the circuit breaker\nand into the light. It then travels back through the neutral and over to its electrical source. Now, of course homes are\nnot connected to a battery, they are connected to transformers. So we're gonna replace the\nbattery with a transformer and there we go, we\nhave a complete circuit. The electricity in this circuit\nis AC, alternating current, which is different from\nthe DC, direct current, which we saw with the battery. With DC, the electrons flow directly from A to B in only one direction, much like the flow of water down a river, but in our homes we have\nAC, alternating current, which means the electrons\nalternate their direction between forwards and backwards much like the tide of the sea. Now, in North America, we\nhave a split phase supply to most residential properties. So we have the two hot\nwires and one neutral wire. We simply have two 120V coils\nwhich are connected together in the transformer. The neutral is then\nconnected to the centre between the two coils. When we connect our multimeter between a hot and the neutral, then we're going to get\na reading of around 120V, and we get the same\nreading for the other one. That's because we're only\nusing half of the coil in the transformer. But then when we connect\nbetween the two hots, we get 240V because we're\nusing the full length of the transformer coil. Now, if you don't have a multimeter, I highly encourage you to get one, links down below for which\none to get and from where. Now, if we have a load on\nonly one half of the coil and the load is, for example, 20Amps, then the hot wire will\ncarry 20Amps to the load and the neutral wire will carry\n20Amps back to the source. You can measure the current in a cable using a current clamp meter. Again, links down below for\nwhich one to get and from where. If you don't know what\ncurrent or amps are, then check out our video\non electrical current, link to that in the video\ndescription below also. Now, if we have another load\non our other half of the coil and the load is a different value, say for example just 15Amps,then\nthe neutral will only carry the difference between\nthese two values back to the transformer or back\nto the electrical source. So in this case, one side we have 20Amps and the other side we have 15Amps, so the difference between\nthese is five amps. So the neutral will carry five amps. Where does the rest of this go? Well, it will pass\nthrough the two hot wires. And this is what we have in most cases because there are multiple\ncircuits with different loads in the residential property. However, if we had a load on both coils and they're of equal value,\nsay for example 15Amps each. Then there will be no current\nflowing in the neutral wire. So where is it going? Well, it's flowing back and\nforth on the two hot wires between the load and the source. That's because it's AC,\nalternating current, and the transformer is\ncentre tapped with a neutral. So while one half is moving forwards, the other half is moving backwards and the current will flow\ninto the other circuit instead of back via the neutral. Hopefully, that hasn't\nconfused you too much. If it has, then don't worry\nabout it too much for now, we're gonna cover that\nin a more advanced video. So the hot wires carry\nthe electrical current from the supply and over to the load and the neutral wires carry\nthe electrical current from the load and back to the supply. So what does the ground wire do? The ground wire, under\nnormal operating conditions, will not carry any electrical current. This wire will only\ncarry electrical current in the event of a ground fault. Hopefully, this wire will\notherwise never ever be used at all in its entire life. It's just there for an emergency path for the electricity to get\nback to the power source instead of it passing through you. The ground wire in most\ncases is a bare copper wire, it's uninsulated, but in\nsome cases it is covered with a green insulation. This wire has a very very low resistance so electricity will\nprefer to travel along it because it's easier and\ncan get back quicker. Now if we go back to the simple circuit with a battery and a lamp,\nif we now run another wire and run this from the positive\nterminal over to the lamp and we connect this to the\nmetal of the lamp holder, then this is effectively our ground wire. As you can see, it's not being\nused to carry electricity. If the hot wire touches the metal casing then the electricity will now flow through the ground wire instead. If the hot wire is connected\nto both the neutral and the ground, then it will now flow through both wires back to the source. But as the ground wire\nhas less resistance, then more current will flow through it. When electricity finds a\nway to leave its circuit and return to the source\nthrough a different way than its neutral wire, this\nis called a ground fault. Coming back to the house, the electricity flows through the hot wire and into the light and then\nback through the neutral, but if the hot touches the metal casing, then it will instead flow\nthrough the ground wire back to the panel, through the busbar and then back to the transformer\nvia the neutral wire. The ground wire has a very low resistance which causes a huge and\ninstantaneous increase in current which will trip the breaker. We therefore connect the\nground wires to anything that could potentially\nbecome a potential path for electricity to leave its circuit, such as the metal pipes, the metal plates and the light switches and\nthe outlets of the boxes, we also need to run one to the outlets because often our\nappliances are made of metal or they're covered with a metal casing, the things like washing\nmachines and microwaves. When you look at a receptacle and plug, you'll see that there is a hot terminal, a neutral terminal and a ground terminal. The casing of something\nlike a washing machine is connected to a ground wire in the lead which goes to the plug,\nthrough the receptacle and back to the panel to save\nyou from an electric shock. Now, let's say you're\noutside with no shoes on and the ground or the soil is moist. If you touch a hot wire, you\ncould complete the circuit and current may pass through\nyou to get back to the supply. In this case, the resistance\nis going to be very high. So the current might not be high enough to automatically flip the\nbreaker and cut the power. This will likely lead\nto the person's death. Luckily we have the GFCI\nreceptacle or the GFCI breaker. GFCI stands for Ground\nFault Circuit Interrupter. We're gonna look at a\ncircuit breaker version but essentially they're\ngonna work the same. This GFCI breaker is going to be connected to both the hot and the\nneutral of the circuit, and so we can monitor the wires and ensure that the current running in\nthe hot wire of the circuit is equal to the current running in the neutral wire of the circuit. If the current is not\nequal in these two wires, then it's clearly flowing\nback to the source via another route, we\nthen have a ground fault. The breaker will realize\nthis and very quickly and automatically flip to cut the power and kill the circuit. Connected to the main panel, we will find a thick copper wire which leads out to a ground rod. A ground rod is buried into the ground outside near the property. This rod is not used for ground faults. Its purpose is to dissipate\nstatic electricity and external high voltages\nlike lightning strikes. There is also a ground rod\nconnected to the neutral at the transformer. Many people think that\nduring a ground fault electricity flows through the ground rod and into the earth. Now, remember electricity tries\nto get back to its source. It doesn't just go into the earth. Unless there is a ground\nrod at the transformer, then there is a potential\npath for the electricity to get back to the source,\nbut this path will have a very high resistance for impedance. And as we know, electricity\nwill take preference over the path with the least resistance. So as we already have a very\nlow resistance ground wire which provides a path\ndirectly back to the source, the ground fault is going\nto take this route instead. When it comes to lightning, the source of lightning\nis essentially the earth. So lightning is always trying\nto get back to its source which is the earth. If lightning strikes the utility cables, it will flow along the wires\nto get to the ground rods of both the transformer\nand also your main panel. It's gonna do this to try\nand get back into the earth. If it wasn't for this,\nthen it's going to blow all our circuits then it's\ngonna cause house fires. Now, if the hot wire\ncame into direct contact with the ground rod, then\nelectricity will flow through the soil, back to the transformer, but the resistance is very high\nso the current will be low. This means the circuit breaker will not likely detect the fault and the circuit breaker\nwill not automatically flip to cut the power. Okay guys, that's it for this video but to continue learning, then click on one of\nthe videos onscreen now and I'll catch you there\nfor the next lesson.

        "transcription": "Have you ever wondered how a flashlight works? Sure, it seems pretty simple...all you have\nto do is move a switch or press a button, and...ta da! The light comes on! But what really makes the light go on? Right you are, Squeaks! It‚Äôs electricity that makes the light go\non. You probably already know something about the electricity that powers things in your house. Well, the electricity in a flashlight comes\nfrom the batteries that are inside. Electricity flows from the battery to a light\nbulb. And when the electricity goes through the\nbulb, the flashlight lights up! But the electricity doesn‚Äôt just jump from\nthe battery right to the bulb. In order to get from the battery to the light\nbulb, the electricity has to go along a specific path. And that path is called a circuit. If you listen to the word \"circuit\", it kind\nof sounds like a shape you might know. Let's name some shapes, and see which one sounds like ‚Äúcircuit!‚Äù Triangle...no...square...no...I know, circle! And if you look at a circle, you see that\nit goes around and around and doesn't have any spaces or gaps in it. And that‚Äôs true of a circuit, too! There can‚Äôt be any spaces in the path that\nelectricity takes to get from a battery to a light bulb. In a circuit, if electricity doesn't have\na path to travel on, it stops. It‚Äôs a little like a train on train tracks...when\nthere‚Äôs no more track, the train stops. So let‚Äôs see how a simple circuit works. The battery is what we call the power source\n‚Ä¶ that is, it‚Äôs where the electricity comes from in this circuit. Electricity flows from the power source on the path of the circuit. And a lot of the time, that path is made by\nsome kind of a wire. The circuit then leads to whatever we want to power. In this circuit, that‚Äôs a light bulb. As the electricity goes through the bulb,\nthe bulb lights up. The electricity leaves the bulb, and flows\nback through the battery. Then it follows the circuit all over again! As long as there are no spaces in the circuit, the bulb will stay lit. But what if we want to turn the light on and off? Then we have to break the circuit, which means we need to put a space in it somewhere to stop the flow of electricity. So...we use a switch. A switch allows us to make a space in the\ncircuit if we want to. When the switch is on, there‚Äôs no space\nin the circuit, and the light bulb is lit. But when we move the switch off, we open up a space. The electricity can‚Äôt jump over the space,\nso it can‚Äôt reach the light bulb...and the bulb stays off! Okay, so I‚Äôm going to try to build my own\ncircuit using some of the parts that I have here. I have a power source: this battery ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ and a wire for the electricity to travel\nthrough ...and a little light bulb. If I arrange everything just so, it kind of\nlooks like a circle! But the bulb isn‚Äôt on. That‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt connected all\nof the pieces together. Remember, there can‚Äôt be any spaces in the circuit. So I‚Äôll connect the wires to the power source...then\nI‚Äôll connect one wire to the bulb‚Ä¶ And when I connect the other wire to the bulb and complete the circuit...the bulb lights up! Now, I‚Äôm going to add something else to\nmake it work more like our flashlight does. I have this part that looks like a button. And I‚Äôm going to put it right here. And look! The bulb is lighting up. That means that there are no spaces in the circuit. Okay Squeaks, I‚Äôll press the button! Hey, the light is on now! That means that when I press the button, the circuit is incomplete...that means there‚Äôs a space. And when I let go of the button, the circuit\nis complete again. The electricity from the battery can‚Äôt cross\nthe space, so it can‚Äôt get to the bulb and make it light up. The button is a switch, just like a switch\non a flashlight! If you look around, you‚Äôll find that circuits\njust like this are everywhere, powering all of the things around you! Cars, trucks, and buses all use a circuit\nwith a battery to get started. And circuits run through your refrigerator,\ntoo, and in all of the other machines in your home that use electric power in order to work. Inside devices like phones and computers -- which\nyou‚Äôre using right now -- there are very, very small circuits that use the same basic set-up as the one I just built! Large or small, it takes a circuit to carry\nthe power we need to get going! Thanks for joining us on SciShow Kids. And special thanks to Google Making Science\nfor helping us make this video!

development i was quite surprised because i got a really overwhelming response with most of you being very interested i was quite happy about that because hardware is one of my favorite things to work on hence the channel name but ironically i haven't actually done much hardware work on this channel the main reason i've kind of avoided it is because generally it is quite difficult and i didn't think many of you would be that interested in it but you do seem kind of interested to learn so i thought i'd create this video and see if anyone finds it useful so going into this one thing i didn't want to do was just dive straight into programming tutorials mainly because hardware is a very complicated field and it can be quite tricky to learn especially because a lot of people will skip over the basics as with anything you always want to get the basics down first as a good foundation and then build off of that so as a starting point i thought i'd create this video as an introduction to microcontrollers and embedded systems i'll cover what they are where they're used and why they're useful hope you enjoy it all right so you can see in front of me here i have a few different boards each of these boards has a microcontroller on it they come in all different shapes and sizes but generally they're easy to spot the chips are actually these black devices here in the middle of the boards the boards also come in many different shapes and sizes and you can see that around the microcontroller we generally have a lot of other components and they're called our peripherals before we talk more about these boards let's go a little bit deeper into microcontrollers and embedded systems what are they and what do they do a microcontroller is a chip optimized to control other electronic devices so you can almost think of it like the brain of a system kind of similar to the microprocessor you'd find in a desktop pc but with a few very key differences microcontrollers are intended for use in very specific applications whereas desktop computers are designed to multitask and run complex operating systems there are three main elements that make up a microcontroller cpu memory and io or input output to connect to our external peripherals the interesting thing about microcontrollers is that they actually have all three of those components all built into a single chip this makes them extremely useful for smaller devices that we tend to call embedded systems you've probably already heard of iot or internet of things and that whole idea basically stems from these kind of devices the idea behind iot is to have all these individual devices all connected together and communicating so what classifies as an embedded system embedded systems are all around us and it's funny because in the world today we tend to take everything for granted something like this tv remote for example most people are just going to grab it use it and not really think too much about what's going on inside but a lot of effort goes into something even as simple as this and that's what i love about electronics and embedded systems there's kind of like this whole other world going on underneath what we see at face value when you dive into it and start asking all these questions about how things like this work you start to become a lot more grateful for all the technology we have today that makes our lives so much easier so an embedded system is a digital device that is dedicated to a specific task so for example this tv remote is an embedded system it has only one job to do which is to send frequencies to the tv so that you can control and use it this ps4 controller is also an embedded system it also only has one job to do which is to send your user input data to the ps4 via bluetooth an example of something that isn't an embedded system would be your smartphone or desktop computer smartphones and desktop computers run on complex operating systems that are generally designed to multitask the smartphone for example can be whatever you want it to be you can play games on it you can phone people you can text people you can use the camera you can browse the internet it has so many different uses that is not considered an embedded system other examples of an embedded system would include digital watches microwave ovens washing machines and the list just goes on and on the important thing to remember though is that at the core of all these devices is a microcontroller just like the ones we're looking at here a microcontroller on its own isn't very useful so let's talk a little bit about peripherals what classifies as a peripheral a peripheral is any electronic device or component that's external to the microcontroller notice on these development boards we have a lot of other components and ports around the outside of the chip these ports and components all connect to the tiny pins on the chips and we can use these ports around the outside to connect our microcontroller to external devices and peripherals i have a few devices here that will be considered as peripherals the simple peripherals are things such as keypads leds microphones buzzers and again the list keeps going but then you can have more advanced peripherals such as integrated circuits sensors or lcd displays these type of peripherals will use communication protocols such as i squared c or spi but that's a topic for another video you can see here we've got two lcd displays both different sizes we've got sensors this is an accelerometer gyroscope this is an ultrasonic sensor this is a speaker and obviously this is a tiny little 5 volt fan all of these are classed as peripherals because they're external to our microcontroller and we can use our microcontroller to control and talk to all these different devices these kinds of boards that we're looking at here are designed for testing and development purposes if for example you wanted to develop your own alarm clock you would first build and test the system on one of these boards before you go ahead and create a custom printed circuit board these boards are generally quite big but you actually only need the chip and a few other components to run an embedded system the manufacturers generally add in a few more components for you so that you can experiment and play around with stuff that already exists on the board for example if we wanted to interface to this accelerometer and gyroscope we would have to connect all these pins up to some of our external pins on the board and then we could use a communication protocol called i squared c to communicate with this other device and fetch information from it these two boards here are arduino boards and they both contain 80 mega micro controllers now personally i don't really regard arduino as a real hardware development platform the software tools are very limited and honestly the boards are aimed at kids or hobbyists who are just looking to learn and play around with really basic electronics they're great boards if you want to prototype something super fast but from my experience in industry if you're serious about learning hardware development you'll want to stay away from arduino and go with something that's a little more capable and just more respected in the industry these two boards here were created by st micro electronics one of the most reputable semiconductor manufacturers in the world both boards have arm cortex m4 microcontrollers that are industry standard and packed full of extremely useful features this nuclear board has a smaller 64 pin chip whereas the f4 discovery board has a larger 100 pin chip i think it's fair to say that the 64 pin chip on this board would cover 90 of projects just because you're never really going to use all 64 pins unless you're building a really advanced embedded system in which case you'd want to use a more powerful chip with more capability so you'd go for something like this one it really does come down to personal preference and there are just so many options out there for you you'll also notice that the stm32f4 discovery has more peripherals on board for you to play around with it has an accelerom and a gyroscope built onto the board it also has audio output it has usb on the go for file storage and data transfer and so many of these gpio pins for you to connect up to your other peripherals you can also configure these pins in a very flexible way and we'll cover that in another video where i talk you through some of the software on how you set up these chips one of the things i love most about these stm32 boards is that they come with a debugger already attached to the board you can see the debugger here at the top of the board this means you can actually break point and step through your code which means you can debug properly whereas on the arduino the only real option you have for debugging is to print to the console which is honestly not good what i like about st especially is that they're one of the few manufacturers out there that provide good documentation and resources for you to use that's really important because hardware development requires you to read through lots of data sheets on how to actually program these chips the chips are so advanced and have so many features that the programming manuals and data sheets provided by the manufacturers can often be you know up to a thousand pages long don't let that put you off though it's actually a really good thing because most manufacturers sometimes produce a device they ship it and the documentation is really poor and you kind of just left to figure it all out by yourself definitely not the case with st though the documentation is awesome so now that we know a bit more about microcontrollers embedded systems and peripherals you might be thinking well what can we actually use all this stuff for and the answer to that question honestly is anything you're only really limited by your imagination provided you have all the hardware that you need and enough power you can create anything you want i recently did a project where i designed and 3d printed my own rc car for that project i used one of these stm32f4 discovery boards and using just one of these i was able to control all the hardware and that was quite a complex hardware project adding a microcontroller to your projects it's just a way of adding some automation and intelligence let's look at a very simple example of how we can use microcontrollers to our advantage i've built this really simple led circuit we've got five volts coming into the switch and when i push the switch current flows through the resistor which lights up the led now if i wanted the led to flash every second i could do this by manually pressing the button every second while this does work it isn't very efficient because i'd have to sit here all day and keep pushing this button wouldn't it be great if we had something that could flash this led for us at one second intervals this is where your microcontroller comes in to tell a microcontroller what it needs to do you have to write some firmware generally this firmware will be written in embedded c programming language after writing a program we can flash it directly to the memory of the microcontroller and then whenever we power it up it'll continuously run that code in a loop i've written a simple program that toggles this led on and off every second as you can see when i plug in the usb the microcontroller is running the code and it's completely automated this task for us obviously this is a very simple example but hopefully it sheds some light on just what's possible by adding a microcontroller to one of your projects one of the reasons i enjoy working with these devices so much is that you literally have the freedom to create whatever you want all you need is an idea or a problem that needs to be solved and when combining this kind of skill set with cad and 3d printing you can create some really impressive prototypes so going forward i'm going to start making some tutorials and mini projects around these two boards this is the stm32 nucleo 64. and this is the stm32f4 discovery i'll leave links to both of these boards down in the description below if you're interested in getting hold of them you can pick up both of these boards here in the uk for around 25 pounds and honestly it's one of the best investments you could ever make if you're interested in this kind of stuff i'll also be giving away one of these nuclear 64 boards to one of my website members who help support the channel so if you're not already a member i'll leave a link in the description below where you can join up any support is massively appreciated and all gets reinvested back into this channel so that's it for this video as always i hope you learned something let me know what you think in the comments below and i'll see you in the next video"

        "transcription": "hi I'm Becky Stern and today we're learning how to pick the best microcontroller for your [Music] project the brain of your project can take many forms and it could be overwhelming to try to pick one from the vast selection available I'm going to show you how to navigate the process including the tradeoffs you'll have to make along the way identify your Project's key features inputs and outputs to determine your requirements related to voltage current jaw communication protocols number of pins you need to connect everything the processor speed and the overall size of your project if any of those terms are new to you I suggest you revisit a few previous episodes in this series introducing Arduino Basics including a detailed guide to building your first project I'll put links in the description and the card above beginners often start with one of these boards an Arduino Uno or something very similar it has labeled IO pins along the edges and female headers so you can easily plug wires into it it runs at 5 volts which is conveniently the same voltage as the USB ports on your computer your charging brick and USB battery pack this board is designed for beginners and it shows you don't have to do any soldering to connect or disconnect your components and everything has enough space around it to fit your fingers and to read the reasonably sized labels the Uno R3 has an 8 bit processor the atga 328 and you can program it using the Arduino software using the Uno as a starting point for comparison we can start to change the properties one at a time either the features on board the form factor or both these days there isn't a huge price difference if we speed up the processor to 32bits and that's why there are so many 32-bit boards available using the arm cortex m0 microcontroller for example my favorite samd21 board is the Gemma MZ from Adafruit and my favorite rp240 board is the Shia rp240 from Seed Studio these faster boards can run Arduino but also a flavor of python if you want a code in python or use one of the kid-friendly blocks code environments like make code that's a good reason to pick a 32-bit microcontroller for your project the next big category of microcontrollers is s so's which stands for system on chip these include boards using the esp32 esp8266 nrf52 and other familiar names you might recognize a system on chip device is engineered to take care of a special feature often Wireless of some sort while letting you run your own code too allinone package all the ones I mentioned and show here also happen to be 32-bit microcontrollers though the term s so doesn't refer to the processor speed my best advice is to match up the features and requirements of your project as well as your abilities with those of your board don't pick a microcontroller with extra functionality you don't need but consider how your project needs might evolve in the future and at what point you might need to graduate to a bigger Andor more powerful board there is no way to compare all of the available boards out there but the make boards guide comes in close in addition to the print and pdf version which I'll link below there is a handy site that lets you compare two boards side by side and it has a big database of popular microcontroller boards across Brands if you're not finding what you're looking for maybe you actually want a single board computer I've got a whole separate video about how they're different from microcontrollers so check that out if you want to learn more the best way to get good at choosing a brain for your project is to practice so using some of my past projects as examples now I'll demonstrate some microcontroller selection in action for my prop replica computer book from Inspector Gadget I needed to host a lot of buttons as digital inputs a bunch of those were illuminated buttons so each of those LEDs needs its own digital output and Arduino Uno has 14 digital IO pins not enough so I could have added some shift registers or upgrade to an Arduino Mega which has 54 digital IO pins remember the iron triangle which weighs against one another the opposing forces of speed quality and cost you can have two but not all three so using the mega was the fast and good solution using shift registers would cost the extra time to change up my wiring and the code to use them but they are inexpensive so that's the cheap solution and how fast and good it is depends on your skill level for my LED beaded curtain I wanted to use a platform somebody else's software to control a big LED grid this is a solved problem and I might as well start with a leg up from folks who've thought about this before me instead of Reinventing the wheel so rather than investigating the specs of specific boards I browsed Community projects and talked to my knowledgeable friends and discovered a couple projects wled and pixel blazed that are doing just that both consist of firmware for your microcontroller and a web or app control interface wled can run on a bunch of different esp8266 and esp32 Boards detailed on its website while pixelblaze sells its own proprietary Hardware this example shows that wanting to use a particularly cool platform is a totally acceptable re reason to choose a particular microcontroller take a look at my LED painting project I needed a microcontroller that was shorter than the thickness of my frame easily able to connect with permanent soldered connections and that could drive neopixels there are lots of boards that satisfy this small list of requirements but I also already had this ardino micro in my stash which is another perfectly acceptable reason to choose a particular microcontroller I also used only what I had on hand for my LED poles project which mostly happened to be the classic Uno shape this was not the absolute best board for the project but in this case I was optimizing for the fastest and cheapest options available to me which was no longer that micro CU I had already put it in my painting for my LED mermaid hair project I wanted something small enough to clip into my hair with a sturdy USBC port for connecting my battery pack and that could also drive my fixed address pixel LEDs the Shia rp240 board is one of the least expensive options that satisfies these requirements though it runs at 3 volts so it's technically at the edge of compatibility since the pixels really want 5 volts but they'll also work at 3 volts in this case if I wanted to run this same project with a li poly battery instead I might go for a Gemma m0 which already has a port for one on board and a Handy onoff Switch the Gemma mzero is also the board I recommend my students use for their LED Halloween costumes it doesn't give you access to very many IO pins but it's perfect for soldering beginners because the few pins that are there are far apart with big pads that are hard to mess up I hope these examples help you understand how to put the concepts into practice I've put some links to resources in the description leave your advice about selecting the microcontroller in the comments so we can all learn together

        "transcription": "What is this magical ‚Äúblack chip‚Äù, that charges your phone, opens your car,¬†\nmakes your coffee in the morning, and even keeps your beer chilled? This is of course a Micro Controller Unit, or MCU. Those ‚Äúchips‚Äù power billions¬†\nof devices all over the world and some of them are so tiny, they¬†\nare smaller than the size of a coin. A microcontroller unit is a small computer on a single integrated circuit, that contains a processor core, memory,¬†\nand programmable input/output peripherals. They are designed for embedded systems and are commonly used in control systems, industrial automation, consumer electronics, and other applications that require a compact, low-power device to perform a specific task. It is very similar to the¬†\nmotherboard of your computer, but in a smaller form factor. The brain of this computer is of course¬†\nthe central processing unit (CPU). It is the primary component¬†\nthat performs arithmetic and¬†¬† logical operations and manages the¬†\nflow of data through the computer. The CPU is connected to memory,¬†\nstorage, and other components through a bus, and it communicates with them to¬†¬† perform tasks and execute instructions¬†\nsuch as ADD, SUB, MOV, and others. Those instructions are low-level machine code and¬†\nare specific to a particular CPU architecture. They are stored in non-volatile memory, which means that your data will¬†\nbe safe if a power outage occurs. BUT! It is also the slowest type of memory, so when your computer boots up, the firmware loads the specific instructions¬†\nfrom the storage to the RAM and the cache. Those two, as well as the virtual memory and the¬†\nregister memory, are much faster but volatile. Brain and memory just by¬†\nthemselves are useless unless,\n ¬† you are a mad scientist stuck in a cucumber. It is like a phone without¬†\nservice or a pen without an ink. In other words, the MCU needs¬†\nperipherals to expand its capabilities. And that is why MCUs come with built-in ones: The basic one are timers that can show you¬†\nthe real-time or generate precise PWM signals; Data converters that convert analog to digital¬†\n(ADC) or digital to analog (DAC) signals; Amplifier peripherals that can¬†\nstrengthen or condition the signal; And communication peripherals that receive and send data to other modules and¬†\nsensors via communion protocols; Of course, you can add other¬†\nperipherals like joysticks, gamepads, fingerprint scanners, or sensors¬†\nto provide additional data, or control the environment, or other devices. All of those features make the¬†\nMCU powerful and very popular.\n ¬† It is compact, has low power consumption, is cost-effective, flexible, and easy to program. Moreover, there is a huge open-source community, where you can gather new ideas and easily debug your problems. The easiest way to start your project is¬†\nto have one of those plug-and-play boards from Arduino, Microchip, or Texas¬†\nInstruments, which you can find on tme.eu. But should you use a microcontroller¬†\nunit for every application? We will check it in the another video!"

        "transcription": "in this video we're going to go over fluids we're going to talk about density buoyant force arames principle Pascal's Law hydraulic lifts Boli's equation and things like that so the first thing that we need to talk about is density the density of an object is the mass divided by the volume this symbol is also known as row now don't confuse it with pressure which I'm going to use capital P now if you rearrange the equation mass is density time volume the density of water is about 1 G per cubic centimeter this is also equal to 1,000 k per Cub meter the specific gravity of a substance is the density of that substance let's say substance a divided by the density of water so for example if the density of aluminum is 2.7 G per Cub CM what is the specific gravity of aluminum is the density of aluminum divided by the density of water and it's simply 2.7 so the specific gravity compares the density of a substance with that of water let's try this problem what is the weight of air inside a spherical balloon of radius 2 m and you're given the density of air ignore the mass of the balloon feel free to pause the video and try this example so let's say if we have a balloon that has a spherical shape and there's gas particles inside the balloon and the gas even though it's light it does have mass so it exerts a downward weight Force what is the weight force of those gas particles we know that weight is equal to mass time gravity and mass is density time volume so the weight of the the air inside the balloon is the density time the volume time gravitational acceleration so it's 1.29 kilog per cubic meter that's the density but we need to find the volume the volume of a sphere is 4/3 pi r Cub the radius is 2 m so 2 to the 3 power that's 8 8 * 4 is 32 32 ID 3 is 10.67 * pi this is about 3351 cubic M so that's the volume times the gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m/s squ so if we multiply these three numbers this will give us a weight force of 423.15 now let's say if you place a chunk of aluminum what's going to happen will it sink or float the density of aluminum is about 2.7 G per cubic meter I mean cubic ctim which is 2700 kilog per cubic meter so because aluminum has a higher density than water it will sink but let's say if you place an ice cube in water ice floats on top of water the reason why ice floats is because the density of ice is less than water the density of ice is about 917 kg per cubic meter so about 91.7% of the volume of ice will be below the surface of water so as you can see heavy objects sink and light objects they tend to float now the same behavior is true for gases let's say if you have a balloon that contains helium helium is lighter than air and so helium is going to rise now if you have a balloon contain in carbon dioxide it's going to sink carbon dioxide is heavier than air air molecules are mostly composed of nitrogen and oxygen gas if you look at the periodic table oxygen has an atomic mass of 16 times the two oxygen atoms that you see here so the M mass is about 32 G per Mo for N2 it's 14 * 2 is 28 now air is about 78 to 79% of nitrogen and approximately 21% oxygen there's some other gases too but it's around this number so we'll say that nitrogen is 78% and then the other 1% is the other gases so the average molar mass of air is somewhere between 28 and 32 the M mass of helium is four the M mass of Co 2 is 12 + 16 * 2 that's 44 so because carbon dioxide is heavier than air it's going to sink but because helium is lighter than air it's going to rise another fun fact about air is temperature hot air rises and cold air sinks in hot air the gas gas particles are further apart and so hot air is less dense than cold air in cold air the gas particles are closer together and so cold air has a higher density than hot air so hot air tends to rise cold air tends to sink if you live in a three-story apartment or house if you turn on the AC you realize that the first floor even the basement will be the coldest area in the house and the the attic is usually the hottest part of the house that's because all the hot air rises towards the attic and the cold air sinks towards the basement so this principle is useful for hot air balloons for example let's say if you have a a very massive hot air balloon let's say there's a torch so as you heat up the air inside the balloon the balloon expands and the hot air is less dense or lighter than a surrounded in cooler air so let's say the temperature inside this balloon is maybe 50¬∞ C and outside let's say it's 20 so as you heat up the air on inside the hot air will rise now if you want the hot air balloon to descend you basically uh turn this off and the temperature will decrease and eventually the weight of the balloon and this package or the people inside it will eventually cause the hot air balloon to descend so by adjusting the temperature you can control if it's going to ascend or descend now here's a question for you is it easier to float in pure water or in salt water what would you say so is it easier to float let's say in a pool versus the ocean in a pool it's mostly pure water there might be some chlorine inside of it too but for the most part the density of the water that you'll find in a typical pool is about 1,000 kg per cubic meter now the density of sea water which is basically salt water is a little bit higher it's about 1,25 kg per cubic meter so therefore it's easier to float in the Ocean than in a pool because the density of seawater is higher than that of a typical pool now let's say if you were to go to a very salty lake water let's say like the Dead Sea or something the density of the Dead Sea is very very high because it's so salty if you were to jump in and try to swim to the bottom you won't be able to the bo Force there is so strong that it's going to lift you back to the top and you're going to float right on top of it the density of the Dead Sea water is about 1240 kilog per cubic meter and the higher the density of a fluid the harder it is to sink it's easier to float so it's easier to float in sea water than is to float in a pool by the way a fluid is anything that could flow so liquids and gases because they can both flow or considered to be fluids let's try a problem An Empty Bottle has a mass of 25 G if you fill it with water the combined mass is 95 G when filled with another fluid the combined mass is 75 gram what is the density of this unknown fluid so what would you do in this problem so we need to find the volume of the empty bottle of water because if we have that then using the mass of the fluid we can calculate the density of the fluid now we know the density of water it's about 1 G per cubic centm so what is the mass of the water the combined mass of the bottle and the water is 95 G and the mass of the bottle is 25 so the mass of water must be the difference between these two values it's 95 minus 25 which is 70 G so now let's calculate the volume density is equal to mass over volume and volume is mass of a density so 70 G of water divid a density of 1 G per cub CM tells us that the volume of the bottle is 70 Cub CM now that we have the volume of the bottle let's calculate the density of the fluid so first we got to find the mass of the fluid the combined mass of the fluid and the bottle is 75 G and the mass of the bottle is 25 so the mass of the fluid is 75 - 25 so it's 50 g therefore the density of the fluid is the mass divid the volume so it's 50 / 70 50 ID 70 is about 5 over 7 or 714 G per cubic cmet now that we have the density if you need to change units from G per cub cm to kg perb multip th000 so this is equal to 714 kilog per cubic meter so that's the answer for this problem 50 L of water is mixed with 100 L of alcohol what is the density of this mixture to calculate the density of the mixture all we need to do is take the toal mass that is the mass of the water plus the mass of the alcohol and divid the total volume because density is the total mass of the solution divided by the volume or the total volume of the solution now the mass of water is the density of water times the volume of water and the mass of the alcohol is the density of the alcohol divid by the volume of the alcohol and we're going to divided by the total volume so let's separate this fraction into two smaller fractions so it's going to be to keep it simple P1 V1 / V total plus P2 V2 divided by the total volume now the reason why I did it that way is so that you could see that it really doesn't matter what the units of volume are because it's going to cancel if it's in cubic meters or liters it doesn't matter it's the ratio that's important so I don't have to convert liters into cubic meters to get the right answer so therefore the density of the mixture is going to be the density of water which is a th000 times the volume which is 50 L / the total volume which is 150 L plus the density of the alcohol which is 790 times the volume of the alcohol which is 100 L divid the total volume of 15 l so we can cancel these two zeros so the first part 1,00 * 5 / 15 is about 333 so that's the contribution from the water and for the other part 790 * 10 over 15 it's about 5266 if we add the two it's uh 89.6 so that is the density in kilogram per cubic meter for the mixture and it makes sense though notice that the density of the mixture is between the density of water and the density of aluminum now it's not exactly in the middle if you average 1,000 and 790 if you add the two numbers and then divide by two the average between those two numbers is 895 now if we were to mix 50 L of water with 50 lers of alcohol then the density of the mixture should be 895 but notice that the density of the mixture is closer to the density of the alcohol it's between 790 and 8.95 as opposed to 8.95 and a th000 why is the density of the mixture closer to that of alcohol the reason for that is simple we makes more of the alcohol than the water so the density of the mixture should be closer to the density of the pure alcohol than uh pure water now let's talk about pressure so pressure is the ratio between force and area the unit for force is uh Newtons and the unit for area is square meters the unit for pressure is pascals One Pascal is is 1 Newton per square meter and 1 atm or one atmospheric pressure is 101.3 kilopascals kPa or 10,300 pascals now you might see units of tour or millimeters Mercury 1 atm is equal to 760 mm of mercury and this is is also equal to 760 units of tour now these units are usually more associated with chemistry but in physics the standard unit for pressure is uh pascals now let's go over the concept of pressure so let's say if we have a square that is 1 meter by one meter and if we have a larger Square that is 10 m by 10 m now if we apply a force of 100 Newtons across the area of this square and the same force of 100 Newtons across throughout this entire Square which one has a larger pressure value is it the one on the left or the one on the right so pressure is force over area the area for the square on the left is 1 * 1 it's 1 square meter but for the figure on the right it's 10 m * 10 m so it's 100 square m so we have a force of 100 Newtons being applied over an area of 1 square met so the pressure is force over area it's 100 scals now for the figure on the right 100 Newtons is being applied over an area of 100 square met so 100 over 100 is 1 Pascal so the pressure is significantly higher on the figure on the right so if you apply a force over a very small area the pressure is going to be very very high to illustrate this concept let's say if you push someone with your hand and you apply a gentle Force it's not going to cause much damage but let's say if you apply the same Force but with a pen and you poke some one with the pen which one is going to cause more damage pushing someone with your hand or applying the same force with a pen because the area of a pen is so small and if you apply the same force over such a small area the pressure is significant higher for example if you push someone let's say you apply a force of 100 Newtons and let's say the area of this surface is 1 square meter the pressure is only 100 pascals but now let's say if you apply a force of 100 and let's say this area is is significantly small let's say it's 01 squ M 100 / 01 is 10,000 so the pressure is significantly larger because the area is so much smaller and that's why poking someone with a pen causes much more damage than pushing someone gently with the palm of your hand it's because you're applying a significant force over a very very small area so the pressure is very large now let's say if we have a rectangular box and let's say the dimensions of the Box are 5 m by 4 m and it has a height of 3 m and let's say the mass of the box is 100 kilg now what is the pressure exerted by the box at the ground below so let's say the box is on this horizontal surface what is the pressure exerted in a Shader region so we know that pressure is force / area and the force exerted on the table in the purple shaded region is basically the weight of the box which is mg so the mass of the box is 100 the gravitational acceleration is 9.8 and the area of the bottom surface is basically the length times the width we don't need the height so it's 5 * 4 so the weight force is 100 * 9.8 which is 9800 Newtons applied over an area of 20 square m so 980 / 2 is 490 so the pressure is 4 990 pascals now let's say if we have a very tall container that is filled with water and let's say the container is sealed so it's not open to the atmosphere how can we calculate the pressure at this point in this container so it's filled with water how can we find a pressure let's say it's a very large tank and we want to find a pressure 5 M below the surface what can we do so we know that pressure is force ID area so the force is going to be the weight of the water mg that is currently Above This surface where the point of interest is located so the mass of water exerts a downward force on its cross-sectional area and that weight force is the mass of the water above it times the gravitational acceleration divided by the area now because we have a fluid is best to think of the mass of a fluid as being the density multiplied by the volume remember density is mass over volume so mass is density time volume so let's replace M with PV so the pressure at that surface is the density of the fluid times the volume of the fluid above it multiplied by gravitational acceleration times the area now the volume of the water above it is basically the volume of a rectangle which is the length time the width times the height so the volume as you mentioned before is L * H * W now length time width will give us the area of this surface which is basically the area of this surface here so length time width is area so volume equals area time height so let's replace V with area time height so the pressure is going to be the density time the area time the height time gravitational acceleration divided by the area so we can cancel a therefore the pressure due to the water Above This cross-sectional area is equal to the density time the gravity time the height so now we can calculate it the density of water is about 1,000 kilg per cubic met time G which is 9.8 * 5 m so it's basically 5,000 * 9.8 so the pressure due to to the water above that point of interest is 49,000 pascals now what would be the pressure if this container was not closed if it was open to the environment in that case the pressure at this point would be higher because you have the weight of the atmosphere pushing down on the fluid so in this case the pressure at the point of interest is going to be called the absolute pressure that's uh p and that's equal to the pressure of the atmosphere plus the gauge pressure the gauge pressure is simply the pressure that is above the atmosphere the atmospheric pressure is 10,300 pascals and the gauge pressure is the pressure due to the weight of the water above that cross-sectional area so that's the 49 ,000 pascals so the absolute pressure at that point is going to be 150,000 and 300 pascals let's try another problem let's say if we have a container that's open to the atmosphere and we have water and we also have let's say oil the density of the water we know it to be 1,000 kg per cubic meter and let's say the density of the oil above it is 700 kg per cubic meter and let's say that the height of the oil is about 4 M and the height of the water is about five meters and let's not forget that we have the weight of the atmosphere basically the weight of all the air molecules Above This fluid pressing down on it exerting its own pressure so what is the pressure at the bottom of this container so that pressure the absolute pressure or the total pressure at that point is the sum of the pressures caused by the weight of the water above that point plus the weight of the oil and the weight of the atmosphere so the pressure or the gauge pressure due to water alone it's going to be the density of water times the gravitational acceleration times the height and the pressure caused by the oil is the density of the oil time G * h plus the atmospheric pressure the density of water is about 1,000 G is 9.8 and the height of the water is about five plus the density of the oil which is 700 time G time the height of the oil which is four and then plus the pressure due to the atmosphere which is 10,300 pascals so 5,000 * 9.8 that's 49,000 that's the pressure due to H2O alone and then 700 * 9.8 * 4 that's uh 27,44 plus the weight of the or the pressure due to the atmosphere so if we add the three numbers 27440 + 49,000 + 101 300 the absolute pressure at this point or the total pressure is 17,745 now here's the question for you let's say if we have a rectangular surface and it's 8 m by 9 M and we want to calculate the total force exerted by the atmosphere on this surface how would you do it so we know that pressure is force divid area so the force exerted by the atmosphere on the surface is pressure times area and the area of the surface is the length times the width so the force exerted by the atmosphere is the pressure of the atmosphere which is 101300 pascals times a length of 9 and a width of eight so over this large area the force exerted by the atmosphere is 7, 293,000 and 600 Newtons of force so that's the entire weight of the air above this particular surface so all of the molecules imagine if this was one big vertical column that extended from the ground to outer space the weight of all of the molecules in this vertical column is equal to this Force right here so that's the weight of the atmosphere Above This surface from the Earth to outer space now the next topic of interest is the hydraulic lift now this device is filled with a fluid according to Pascal's principle the pressure applied to a confined fluid increases the pressure throughout by the same amount so the pressure that we exert on one side let's call it the input pressure is equal to the pressure exerted on the other side the output pressure so if we apply a force over this uh circular area we're going to exert a pressure and that input pressure is the input force divided by the area and an output force will be exerted that output force divided by A2 is equal to the output pressure let's call it F2 so if we cross multiply we're going to get the equation fub1 A2 is equal to F2 A1 and if we solve for F2 by dividing both sides by A1 we get this equation F2 = fub1 time the ratio of the areas A2 over A1 so let's uh make some more space now let's apply an input force of 100 Newtons and let's say that the area or the radius of that cylinder is 10 cm and let's say the radius of this cylinder is 30 cm what is the output force that's going to be exerted by this cylinder if we apply an input force of 100 Newtons so using this equation FS2 is equal to fub1 which is 100 Newtons time A2 which is basically Pi * the radius squar over A1 which is pi r1^ 2 now we can cancel the pi values so simply the ratio of the radius of those two circles so R2 is 30 cm but we need to square R1 is 10 cm and we need to square it as well so the unit centimeters will cancel we don't really need to change it to meters so it's 100 * 30 2 which is 900 / 10^ 2 which is 100 so F2 is equal to 900 Newtons now let's think about what this means the output force was increased by a factor of nine it went from 100 to 900 so that means that the mechanical advantage of this machine is equal to 9 because it was able to multiply the force the input force by a factor of n mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force divided by the input force now even though the force was multiplied by a factor of nine it wasn't a freebie so to speak there was a cost for it it wasn't free so what was the cost that we had to pay to increase the force by a factor of nine it turns out that the input work that you apply to this device is equal to the output work so fub1 * D1 is equal to FS2 * D2 now let's say if the hydraulic lift went up by 1 meter that means that we have have to apply a force of 100 Newtons for a distance of 9 M because the work can't be increased now we can lose energy by means of friction but let's say if we have a perfect ideal situation the input work equals the output work so the input work is basically a force of 100 Newtons times the distance of 9 M which is 900w the output work is the same the machine applies a force of 900 Newtons but it only moves a distance of 1 meter so it exerts 900 Jew of energy so there's no gain in energy in a system so we basically apply a small force over a longer distance and we get a larger Force applied over a shorter distance the concept is similar to that have a lever a lever allows you to leverage your Force to multiply so you can lift a larger object for example let's say if the lever arm on the left side is 8 m and on the right side it's 2 m if you apply an input force of 100 Newtons the output force is going to be 400 newtons the torque created by F1 is equal to the force times the moment arm or the L arm which is perpendicular to the axis of rotation it's actually perpendicular to the line of action and it's between the axis of rotation or the pivot point so that's the moment arm so T1 is 100 * 8 so the torque on the left side is 800 Newtons time meters now this creates another torque that has the same magnitude 2 * 400 is also 800 but as you can see with the lever the smaller force is associated with the longer side and the larger force is associated with the shorter side and the same is true for the hydraulic life the larger force is associated with the shorter side and the smaller force is associated with the shorter distance so now let's work on another problem with the hydraulic lift so let's say if we have if we want to lift a crate that has a mass of 800 kg and we want to lift it by a distance of let's say 50 cm and let's say that the radius of this portion of the hydrog let's say it's 60 cm and the radius of this circle let's say it's 10 cm so what is the input force that we need to apply to lift the 800 kilogram uh Crate by a distance of 50 cm and also what distance do we need to push down on the left side and also what is the pressure exerted on this surface and what is the work that we need to apply to move this object 50 cm High calculate the work using two formulas the first thing that we should do is find the output force the minimum output force that we need to lift the 800 kgam block or crate is the weight Force so F2 has to at least be equal to the weight force in order to lift this object up 50 cm so F2 is equal to mg which is 800 * 9.8 so the output force is about 78 40 Newtons so now that we have FS2 we can calculate fub1 fub1 / A1 is equal to FS2 / A2 the input pressure is equal to the output pressure according to Pascal's principle so looking for F1 A1 is p piun r s but like in the last example we can cancel the pi constants so it's just going to be ID R1 2 which is 10 cm s and we could leave it in units of centimeters so A2 the pi is canceled so it's just going to be R2 which is 60 cm s and F2 is 7840 so let's cross multiply so fub1 * 60 2 let's get of this is equal to 10^ 2 time 7840 10 2 is 100 * 7840 that's 78400 / 60 2 and so F1 or the input force is 27 17.8 Newtons now how can we calculate the input distance how far do we need to push this particular cylinder down in order to lift the 800 kilogram block 50 cm up what do we need to do to calculate the answer the input work must be equal to the output work and we could find the output work which is the work required to lift an object Against Gravity and whenever you lift an object above ground level you're increase in the potential energy so the work required is basically the change in potential energy which is mg Delta H and the weight Force mg is basically FS2 and the change in height is basically the vertical displacement so it's going to be Force which is 780 or 7840 times the vertical displacement in meters which is .5 m 50 cm is half of a meter and 100 cm is 1 meter so half of 7840 is 3,920 Jew so that's how much energy is required to lift the 800 kg Crate by 50 cm which which means that we need to apply the same amount of energy to uh push this cylinder down so that this cylinder can go up so the input work and the output work are both 3,920 jws so now that we know the value of the input work we can calculate how far we need to push the cylinder down it's going to be the input force time is the input distance so work is 3,920 the input force is 27.8 and let's solve for D so it's 3920 ided 27.8 so D is about 18 M which is pretty high so we need to apply a force of 218 Newtons and we need to push this cylinder down by a distance of 18 m in order to lift the 800 kgr block by only half a meter so there's no gain in energy however the force does increase so what is the mechanical advantage of this hydraulic liph the mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output force divided by the input force so that's 7,840 ID 27.8 so the mechanical advantage is about 36 so this particular hydraulic lift multiplies the force by a factor of 36 so if you apply a force of 100 Newtons the output force will be 100 * 36 or 3600 Newtons now it turns out that there's another way to calculate the mechanical advantage the mechanical advantage of this hydraulic lift is also equal to the ratio of the input distance divided by the output distance so we had to push the cylinder on the left by a distance of 18 m so that the 800 kgam crate can go up by .5 M so 18 divided by 0.5 is 36 so there's a trade-off if you want to increase the force you have to apply a smaller Force for a longer distance so the work done is the same in both cases now the last thing we need to do is calculate the pressure exerted on the cylinder on the left side so pressure is force ID area the force exerted on the left is 27.8 Newtons and the area is the area of a circle which is PK R 2 10 cm is .1 M so 27.8 /12 and let's take that result ID Pi so this is equal to 6,000 933 Newtons well not Newtons but pascals since this is now the pressure so that is it for the hydraulic cph so now the next topic of discussion is the Mercury barometer so let's say if we have a beaker and if we have a tube and it's filled with Mercury now this barometer is open to the atmospheric pressure so the weight of the air exerts a force and the pressure inside is zero so the difference in pressure is just the atmospheric pressure with this information how can you calculate the height of the Mercury column how high is it above this level what's the difference in height now let's say that you know the density of mercury the density of liquid mercury is about 13,600 kilog per cubic meter and you know the atmospheric pressure so what is the height of the Mercury column now to figure this out we need to understand that the weight of the atmosphere which is associated with the atmospheric pressure balances out the weight of this Mercury column and the weight of the Mercury column is associated with the gauge pressure so we could say that because the weight of the atmosphere must balance the weight of that mercury column the atmospheric pressure must equal the gauge pressure and the gauge pressure is simply the density of the fluid times the gravitational acceleration times the height now we know the atmospheric pressure it's 10,300 pascals the density of mercury is 13,600 the G is 9.8 so we need to solve for the height so the height of the Mercury column is about 76 M which is approximately 76 CM now let's say if we replace Mercury with water how high can the atmosphere support a column of water how high will the water column be so we can use the same equation but this time the density of water is significantly less than that of mercury so we should expect that we require a higher column to get the same mass of mercury Mercury is 13.6 times more dense than water so to get the same mass we need a height that's 13.6 times greater than the height of mercury the density of water is a th000 g is 9.8 let's solve for H so the height of the water column that the atmosphere can support is about 10.3 M which is very high now remember the height of the Mercury column was 76 so if you take 76 and multiply it by the ratio of the density of mercury by the density of water you will get this answer 7 6 * 13,600 / 1000 is equal to 10.3 so that's another way you can get the same answer if you know the density of one material and you want to find the height of the other material let's try this problem the height of mercury in an open barometer is 64 cm and the height of another fluid is 154 CM what is the density of the fluid and what is the pressure of the air so let's draw the open perometer and it has a Mercury so let's calculate the pressure of the air first so the outside air is going to exert a pressure and that pressure pushes up the fluid so the weight of the air equals the weight of this column so therefore the pressure of the air is equal to the gauge pressure of that column which is density time gravity time height now for this equation the density of mercury has to be in the units kilog per cubic meter so if it's 13.6 G per cubic cm that's 13,600 kg per Cub m G is 9.8 and the height of the Mercury column in met to convert centim to M divide by 100 so this is going to be 64 so 13,600 * 9.8 * 64 that's about 85,3 N9 pascals so that's the pressure of the air now what about the second part of the problem what is the density of the other fluid now the pressure of the air is equal to the gauge pressure of the other fluid and that's also equal to the gauge pressure of mercury so these two are equal to each other so we could divide by the gravitational acceleration those two will cancel so the density of the fluid times the height of the fluid is equal to the density of mercury times the height of mercury so the density of the fluid we're looking for that the height of the fluid is 154 CM the density of mercury we can use the units grams per cubic cimeter if we use those units then the density of the fluid will also be in G per cubic cm and the height we can leave it in centim because the height of the fluid is in centimet so the unit centimeters will cancel so the density of the fluid is simply the density of mercury which is 13.6 times the height of the Mercury column divided by the height of the fluid column so the density of the unknown fluid is 5.65 G per cubic cm so make sure you understand this because mercury has a higher density the height of the column is going to be less than the height of the fluid that has a lower density so water has a very low density but the height of the water column is very very high it was about like 10 m which is 1,000 CM but Mercury because it has because it's very dense it has a lot of mass per unit volume the column for mercury is very low and so that's why Mercury is very useful to use for uh barometers temperature gauges is because there's a lot of mass per unit volume now let's say if we have a column basically an open barometer with a column and there's going to be two fluids here's the first fluid and here is the second fluid and let's say on the inside the pressure is zero so let's call this fluid a and fluid B and the height of fluid B let's say it's 30 cm and the height of fluid a let's say it's 25 cm and let's say that the density of fluid a is 11 G per cubic cm and a density of fluid B let's say it's 14 G per cub CM so with this information what is the atmospheric pressure how can you calculate it if you have two different fluids so the atmospheric pressure is the sum of the gauge pressure for fluid B which represents or is associated with the weight of that column plus the gauge pressure of fluid a so it's going to be Pa a plus PB so the gauge pressure for fluid a is the density of fluid a times the gravity time the height and for fluid B is simply PGH as well so the density for a now we need it in kilograms per cubic met so that's going to be 11,000 * G which is 9.8 and the height of fluid a in met 25 ID 100 is25 m and then plus the density of B which is 14,000 time 9.8 time the height of B which is3 M and we just got to add the two gauge pressures so 11,000 * 9.8 time 0.25 so the gauge pressure for fluid a is 26950 pascals now for fluid B it's 14,000 * 9.8 * 3 so it's about 41,0 pascals so now let's add these two values so the pressure of the atmosphere under these conditions is about 68,000 110 pascals so that's how you can calculate it with an open barometer that contains two different fluids now let's say if we have an open tube monometer but we're going to have two of them so both manometers will contain mercury but the shapes are going to be a little bit different so on the outside it's open to the atmosphere so this is the atmospheric pressure and we also have the atmospheric pressure on this side as well and this is going to be the pressure of the gas which we can just call it P and then we have the height of the Mercury column or the height difference which we'll call H so how can you write an equation between the pressure of the atmosphere and the pressure inside the gas for each of these situations so these two pressures the pressure of the gas and the pressure of the atmosphere they're going to be they're going to differ by the gauge pressure which is PGH that's the gauge pressure of the Mercury column so how can we find out which equation will be which so here's a question for you which pressure is stronger on the left side is it the atmospheric pressure or the pressure of the gas notice that the gas pushes down more on the Mercury than the atmospheric pressure for the picture on the left therefore this pressure is greater than the atmospheric pressure and it differs by the gauge pressure of the Mercury column so p is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the gauge pressure which is the density time gravity time the height of the Mercury column now on the other side the air pushes down more on the Mercury column than the gas so the atmospheric pressure is stronger so therefore the atmospheric pressure is equal to the pressure of the gas plus the gauge pressure so let's work on some examples now let's say if we have a fluid let's say it's some type of oil and the height difference is about let's say 40 cm and the density of this oil let's say it's pretty heavy let's say it's 3 G per cubic cm and let's say the pressure of the gas is 30 kilopascals or rather let's say the pressure of the at osphere is simply 101.3 kilopascal what is the pressure of the gas so first we need to find out which pressure is greater the atmospheric pressure or the pressure of the gas so the atmospheric pressure pushes down more on the oil than the gas so the atmospheric pressure is greater than the gas so the atmospheric pressure is equal to the pressure of the gas plus the gauge pressure of the oil so that's going to be P plus PGH so we already have the atmospheric pressure which we know it to be 10 1,300 pascals and this is equal to the pressure of the gas plus the gauge pressure of the oil which is the density of the oil in kilog per Cub met which is 3,000 time G and times the height of the column which is4 M so 300 * 9.8 * point4 is about 11,760 so the pressure of the gas is 101300 minus 11760 so it's going to be 89,500 pascals so that's how you can calculate the pressure of the gas inside a monometer you simply need to add or subtract the gauge pressure either from or to the atmospheric pressure and just ask yourself is the gas pressure is it less or greater than the atmospheric pressure and then you can either add or subtract PGH to it so the pressure that's greater is the one that pushes the fluid further into the monometer because the fluid is at a higher level on the right side that means the pressure of the gas is less than the pressure of the atmosphere here it's lower which means that this pressure is greater it exerts a greater down Force now how is it that if we place an object that's that has a higher density than water it will sink but if the density is less than water it will float why do light objects float and heavy objects sink every object has a downward weight Force so what causes the object to move up towards the surface whenever an object is placed in a fluid there's an upward buoyant force and according to Archimedes principle the buoyant force on a body immersed in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by that object so what does that mean anytime you place an object in a fluid this it's going to be an upward boyant Force now how can we calculate this upward boyant Force first we need to draw a better picture so let's draw a cube and let's say this Cube is submerged in water now at the top surface there's going to be a gauge pressure and at the bottom surface there's another gauge pressure and these two pressures because they're at different depths they at a different height the pressures will be different the pressure at the bottom is higher than the pressure at the top so because you have a difference in pressure there's going to be a net upward Force whenever you have a high pressure and a low pressure there's a force that is directed from high to low and so that net force is going to be the bo Force that's going to lift the object in the upward Direction now let's say that the top surface has an area called a and the same is true for the bottom surface so the force acting on the bottom surface we can call FS2 and the force acting on the top surface is fub1 so the net force which is the point force is the difference between FS2 and fub1 F2 is the gauge pressure times the area and fub1 is the gauge pressure times the area as well but these are two different pressures but the area is the same so what we can do is factor out the area so the point force is the area times uh P2 minus P1 which is basically the change in pressure now remember that the gauge pressure is the density time the gravity time the height so the bo force is equal to the area times the density times the gravity times the change in height which is basically the height of the box so now area time height is volume so point force is equal to the density of the fluid times gravity times the volume of the object that is submerged so this is the Bo Force that's how you can calculate it let's try this problem so we have a tank that contains water and there's a rectangular block of wood we want to know if it's going to sink or if it's going to float so a simple way to find out is to calculate the density of the block and see if it's greater than or less than the density water the density of the block is simply the mass divid by the volume the mass is 175 kg the volume of a rectangle is the length time the width time the height but we need to convert the dimensions to meters and we simply need to divide it by 100 to convert centimeters to meters so 50 ID 100 is .5 so the dimensions are .5 m by 75 by 08 you have to divide each by 100 so 0.5 * 75 * 8 gives us the volume of the block which is.3 cubic M so now we can take the mass and divide it by the volume so 175 ID3 gives us a density of 5833 kilog per cubic meter so notice that the block has a density that's less than that of water so it's going to float it's going to rise to the top so what this means is that the upward buoyant force acting on the Block exceeds the weight force that brings the block down so there's a net upward force that causes it to rise to the surface so so let's calculate the upward buoyant force now according to Archimedes principle the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object and the weight of any object is mass times gravity so the weight of the fluid is the mass of the fluid times the gravitational acceleration and we know that mass is density time volume because density is mass divided by volume so we can replace the mass of the fluid with the density of the fluid times the volume of the fluid displaced which is equal to the volume of the object that is submerged so this is the point force equation that we got earlier in the video so the density of the fluid is a th000 the volume of the fluid is uh or the volume that's displaced is5 * 75 * 8 which is the volume of the block and that's. 3 uh cubic M times the gravitational acceleration of 9.8 so the upward point force is 2,940 Newtons so now let's calculate the weight Force so the weight force is simply the weight of the object it's mg so it's 175 kilg time G which is 9.8 so the weight force is basically 1715 Newtons now the net force is the difference between the upward buyant force and a downward wave Force so the net force is 2940 minus 1715 so the block experiences an upward force of 1225 Newtons so now that we have the net force what is the upward acceleration of the block according to Newton's Second Law net force is equal to mass time acceleration so if the net force is 1225 and if the mass of the block is 175 then the acceleration is 1225 ID 175 so the block has an upward acceleration of 7 m/s squ now acceleration is the rate of change of velocity that means that the upward velocity is increasing by 7 m/ second every second so after a time of 5 Seconds the upward velocity would be it's going to be 35 m/s and you could use the kinematics equation to find out what the final velocity will be at the top or you could find displacement using the kinematics equation so if you need to review that topic you can find my video on YouTube so now that we have the net force and the upward Bo Force what volume of the block will remain above the surface of the water at equilibrium now the buyant force is proportional to the volume of the object that is submerged so as the object rises above the surface of water the bo Force decreases and it's going to rise above the water when it reaches equilibrium that is when the buyant force is equal to the weight of the object at that point the net force is zero and the block of wood no longer continues to rise so when the net force is zero the upward buyant force is equal to the downward weight Force so the buyant force of the object which is the density of the fluid times the volume submerge time G is equal to the weight of the object which is mg now the mass of the object is the density of the object times the volume of the entire object time G so at this point we could divide both sides by G so we'll get a very useful equation the density of the fluid times the volume of the fluid displaced or the volume of the object that is submerged that is under water is equal to the density of the object times the volume of that object that's the entire volume so here's our picture this portion here is the volume that is submerged the part in green whereas the entire block is the volume of the object so let's see the amount that is above the surface of the water and how much is below it so the density of the fluid is a th000 we don't know the volume submerged we know the density of the object it's uh 175 divided by the density which was uh actually the density we had it already was. 3 I just forgot for a moment and the volume of the object is .5 * 75 * 8 well actually the volume is.3 I take that back the density of the object was 175 over3 which is 5 83.3 so basically this whole part right here is just the mass of the wood if you multiply 5833 * .3 you get 175 so this whole thing is just the mass of the object but I'm going to leave the equation in this form because it's useful if you don't know the mass of the object sometimes you'll have the density and the volume of the object so it's going to be 175 ID 1,000 so the volume submerge is the mass of the object divided by the density of the fluid which is75 so if the volume submerged is75 cubic met the volume that's above the surface of the water is the total volume which is3 minus the volume submerged SO3 minus 175 is125 so that is the volume of the block that is above the surface of the water now we can turn it into a percentage .125 /. 3 is 41.7% so 41.7% of the block is above the surface of the water and 175 ID3 gives you the other 58.3% which is below the surface of the water that is the amount that submerged now in this problem we have an ice cube floating on top of liquid mercury so let's say this is liquid mercury and here is the Ice Cube so we want to find out what fraction of the Ice Cube will be submerged in liquid mercury now we know that the density of the fluid time the volume submerge is equal to the density of the object time the volume of the object now let's think about what this equation means because we know that mass is equal to density time volume the density of the object times the volume of the object is equal to the total mass of the object the density of the fluid times the volume of the object submerged is basically the density of the fluid times the volume of the fluid that's displaced vs is the same as the volume displaced so therefore the density of the fluid times the volume displac is equal to the mass of the fluid that is displaced and this is the basic idea behind Archimedes principle the mass of the fluid that's displaced is equal to the the mass of the object now how can we find the fraction of the Ice Cube that's going to be submerged we need to take the volume that is submerged and divided by the total volume so we need to rearrange this equation so first let's divide both sides by V and then let's multiply both sides by 1 over PF so the fraction that we're looking for is equal to the density of the object divided by the density of the fluid so it's going to be 97 ID 13,600 so it's about 0.674 which represents 6.74% so about 6.7% of the Ice Cube will be below the surface of mercury the other 93.3% is above the surface of the fluid so the fraction of the Ice Cube that's submerged is 0674 or 6.7% so here we have a cube that is made up of wood and it's 15 cm in all three dimensions now we have oil on top represented in yellow and water beneath that and block of wood sits it floats literally between the oil and water phases now how is that possible how can this block of wood just float at that point it doesn't rise all the way to the top it doesn't sink all the way to the bottom it just stays in the middle now we know that heavy objects they sink light objects flow so if the density of the oil is 800 and the density of the water is a th000 that means that the density of this block of wood must be between 800 and 1,000 if it was more than a th000 it would sink to the bottom if it was less than 800 it would stay above the oil surface so because it's between 800 and 1,000 it's somewhere in the middle now notice that the cube is 15 cm in length that means that 5 cm is below the interface between the oil and the water and 10 cm is above it so knowing that would you say that the density of this block of wood is it between 800 and 900 or 900 and 1,000 now let's say if the block of wood was right in the middle let's say if it was 7.5 cm above and if it was 7.5 cm below the in face in that case the density would be exactly 900 it would be the average of 800 and 1,000 but notice that the majority of the block of wood is above the interface so is it between 800 and 900 or 900 and 1,000 well we know heavy objects sink light objects float so because it's higher it's more into the oil phase but above the and less than the the water phase so to speak that means it's less dense than 900 it should be between 800 and 900 if more of the block of wood was below the water oil surface let's say if this was 10 and this was five then the density would be between 900 and 1,000 so let's go ahead and calculate the density of this block of wood and all the other things that we need to get now the first thing we're going to do is calculate the gauge pressure at the lower and upper face of the block so let's calculate the gauge pressure at this point and at this point let's call the the pressure at the lower Point P2 and the pressure at the upper Point P1 so P2 is going to be the gauge pressure of the water and the oil combined so this is going to be pressure of H2O plus the gauge pressure of the oil now the gauge pressure caused by water is only the portion of the water that is above that point anytime you have an object above a certain point the weight of that object exerts a force on anything below it and whenever you have a force acting on a certain area there's a pressure at that point so the gauge pressure of water is going to be the density of water time gtimes the height of water above this point which is 5 cm plus the gauge pressure of oil which is the density of the oil times G times the height of the oil above this point so the height of of oil above this point represents the 20 cm it's not 20 + 5 because the 5 cm correlates to the water but the 20 cm is only it's all the oil that's above uh that point so make sure you don't put 25 because we've Incorporated the 5 cm from water so the density of water which is a th000 times G which is 9.8 plus the height of the water above P2 that's 5 cm which is 05 M the density of the oil that's going to be uh 800 time G times the height of the oil that's above the point which is 20 cm divide that by 100 you get20 M 100 * 9.8 * 05 that's about 490 and 800 * 9.8 time20 is about 1568 so the total pressure P2 due to the weight of the oil and the water above that point is 2,58 pascals now what about P1 how can we calculate the gauge pressure at this point now notice that there's no water above P1 so the G pressure is therefore the pressure of oil above that point which is equal to PGH the density of the oil is 800 G is 9.8 but what is the height of the oil what should we plug in for H so the height that we need to use is the height of the oil above that point of Interest the total height of the oil layer is 20 cm and the portion of the block that is above the oil water interface is 10 which means that the height of oil above P1 is also 10 because 10 and 10 is 20 so 10 cm is about .1 M if you divide it by 100 therefore the gauge pressure at P1 is 800 time 9.8 * .1 which is 784 pascals so now that we have the gauge pressure at P1 and P2 let's calculate the forces that the fluid exert at these points so if there's a pressure P2 then that must mean that there's a force that the fluid exerts at P2 and there's another force that the fluid exerts at P1 let's calculate these two forces we know that pressure is force ID area so if you multiply both sides by a pressure time area is equal to the force so let's calculate FS2 first so at the lower surface of this Cube it has an area of 15 cm by 15 cm or 0.15 M by .15 M and the fluid below it exerts an upward Force P2 or I mean F2 so F2 is going to be the pressure P2 times the area of the lower surface P2 is 2058 pascals or Newtons per square meter and let's multiply by5 M squared which is the area of the bottom face of the cube so F2 is 46.3 Newtons so now we need to calculate F1 which is the force that's exerted on the top face of the cube so fub1 is going to be P1 * a and P1 is 784 times the area of5 square meters or 15 M and then Square so F1 is equal to 17. 64 Newtons and F2 is 46.3 Newtons so now that we have the force that the fluid exerts at the bottom and top surfaces now we can calculate the bo Force the buyant force which is an upward force is the difference between F2 and F1 F2 will always be larger than fub1 because the pressure at a greater depth is always higher than a pressure at a higher position within a fluid since there's more weight of the fluid at a lower position so the bo force is FS2 minus fub1 which is going to be uh 46.3 minus 17.64% equal to the density of the fluid times the volume of the fluid displaced which is the same as the volume of the object that is submerged in that fluid times the gravitational acceleration so in this problem there's two fluids so therefore the bo force is going to be PVG for the water plus PVG for the oil so you have to be be careful in the way you uh use this equation so let's start with the water the density of the water is a th000 now what is the volume of the block that is submerged in the water so now think of a cube the volume of a cube is basically the length times the width times the height so if we draw a cube well first let me make some space so here's a rough sketch of a cube so this is the length of the cube this is the width and notice that the cube is not not all of it is in the water phase only a portion so the height of the cube that's in the water phase is about 5 cm so the length and the width of the cube that's 15 * 15 or5 s times the height of the cube that's in the water which is 05 time G so that's the buoyant force due to the water being displaced that Bo force is equal to the weight of the object up to this level now the rest of the object the weight of the upper part of the object is due to the oil so we need to use the height of the object that's in the oil phase for the second part of the equation so that's going to be the density of the oil plus the length and the width which is 15^ s times the height of the cube that's in the oil which is uh 10 cm as opposed to 5 so this is going to be1 in met * 9.8 so 1,00 * 15^ 2 * 05 * 9.8 that's about 11.25 so that's the bo force due to the the water alone and 800 time5 squ time10 * 9.8 is 17.64% oil layer that's due to the oil being displaced around the upper part of the cube now if we add the two values we're going to get 2866 which is the total upward Bo force acting on the cube so now you know how to calculate the bo Force provided by the water and the oil and you know how to calculate the total upward boing Force now how can we calculate the mass and the density of the block now that we know the upward Bo Force so because the block is in equilibrium it's staying it's basically floating between the two layers that means that the net force the net upward force on the Block is equal to zero which means that the upward buoyant force has to balance the weight force in order for it to float at the interface so the bo Force equals the weight Force which means that the bo force of 28. 66 is equal to mg the weight force of the block so 2866 divided by the gravitational acceleration will give us the mass of the block which is 2.9 24 kg now that we have the mass we can calculate the density of the block density is mass divided by volume the mass of the block is 2924 kilograms and the density of the cube is basically the side length raised to the thir power is the length time the width times the height or5 * 15 time5 which is5 M cub and so the density of the block is 866 kilog per cubic meter which makes sense for this block of w to float between the oil and the water layer the density has to be between 800 which is the density of the oil and 1,000 which is the density of water as we mentioned before if it's more than a th000 it's going to sink to the bottom if it's less than 800 it's going to float to the top but if it's between it's going to float in between the two layers and since more of the block of wood is in the oil layer the density has to be between 800 and 900 if the majority of the block of wood was in the water layer the density would have to be between 900 and 1,000 consider this u-shaped tube so it's filled with water and then oil is added on top of it and when it comes to rest it forms this particular shape So based on the shape and the relative Heights that we see here how can you calculate the density of the oil what would you do to find it now it's important to understand that the weight of the oil above the purple line is equal to the weight of the water above the purple line the masses have to be the same so that it's balanced once you understand that you'll realize that the gauge pressure due to the oil is equal to the gauge pressure due to the water above the purple line so because the volume of oil above the purple line is greater than the volume of water above the purple line that means that the oil is lighter in order to have the same mass the oil oil requires a larger volume which means that the density of the oil is less than the density of water so we should get an answer that's less than a th let's go ahead and calculate that answer since the weight of the fluids above the purple line must be the same the gauge pressure of the fluids at the purple line must be equal to each other so the gauge pressure of the oil is equal to the gauge pressure of water at that point at the purple line so PGH is equal to PGH we can cancel G so now we can calculate the density of the oil the height of the oil above the purple line is 40 cm the density of water is a th000 and the height of water above the purple line is the difference between 40 and 18 which is 22 cm now we don't need to convert centimet to meters because the unit centimeters will cancel so it's going to be 1,00 * 22 / 40 so the density of the oil is 550 kilg per cubic meter Which is less than a th000 since there's more oil above the purple line than water in terms of volume so if the mass is the same mass is density times volume if you increase the volume the density has to decrease so since the volume of oil above the purple line is greater than the volume of water the density of the oil has to be less than the density of the water if mass is the same density and volume are inversely related now let's say that that we have a block of aluminum metal and there's a rope attached to it and it's suspended in a vacuum now the upward tension force that supports the weight of the aluminum block let's say it's 1,960 Newtons this is basically the force that a scale would read so if that's the tensent force how can you calculate the mass of the aluminum block now in order for it to remain suspended in a vacuum the tension force must be equal to the weight Force such that the net force in the y direction is zero so T equals W that means that the weight force is 1960 which is equal to mg so 1960 / 9.8 will give you the actual mass of the aluminum block as measured in a vacuum so the mass is 200 kg now what about if the block of aluminum was placed in a tank of water so in this case what is the tension force in the Rope at this point and what is the apparent Mass on the aluminum block if it's fully submerged in water so this is going to be a downward weight Force but because it's displaced in water or it's submerged in water there's an upward buoyant force acting on a block now if it's balanced in its location the net force in the y direction is equal to zero now the sum of all forces in the y direction is going to be the upward tension force plus the upward boyant Force minus the downward weight force and it's equal to zero if it's at rest so if we solve for the tension force it's going to be the weight Force minus the bo Force now the tension force it measures the apparent mass and the last example in a vacuum the tension force measures the actual mass but if you submerge an object in a fluid when you lift it up in a fluid it's going to fill lighter because the point force supports the weight of the object so as you lift it up the bo Force helps you to lift up the object so it feels lighter when lifting an object in water but once you lift it out of water it's it feels heavier because you no longer have the support of the bo Force so the tension force in the Rope it measures the apparent Mass which is mg the weight force is based on the actual mass and the point force is the density of the fluid times the volume that's submerged times the gravitational acceleration so we can divide everything by G so the apparent mass is equal to the actual mass minus the mass of the fluid displace which is the density of the fluid times the volume displaced or the volume of the object that is submerged mass is equal to density time volume so if we solve for volume volume is equal to mass ID density and if the object is fully submerged the volume that is displaced by the water is equal to the actual volume of the object when fully submerged which is the mass of the object divided by the density of the object so let's replace VSS with M over P so the volume that is submerged is equal to the mass of the object divided by the density of that object so now let's factor out the GCF on the right side of the equation which is M so the parent mass is equal to the actual mass * 1 minus the density of the fluid / the density of the object so this equation is true only when the object is fully submerged so now let's calculate the apparent mass for this particular problem so we know that the actual mass of the aluminum block is 200 kg and the density of the fluid which in this case is water is 1,000 and the density of the object which is aluminum is 2700 So if you type this in the calculator exactly the way you see it you'll see that the apparent mass of aluminum when placed in water is 125.95 so remember this is the apparent Mass when it's fully submerged in water now that we have the apperent mass we can calculate the tension force the tension force is the apparent mass time G so it's just 125.95 3.8 Newtons so far we see that the mass measured by an object changes if you place that object in a fluid so in a vacuum an object weighs heavier than wood in a fluid if you place it in water it weighs lighter due to the upward Bo Force now the same is true in air air is a fluid it contains gases so if you want to measure the true mass of an object in air you need to take into consideration the density of the air because air also provides an upward Bo Force for any object displaced within it so let's try this problem what is the apparent mass of a 1,00 kgr block of ice in air so the apparent mass formula is ma is equal to the true mass of an object Time 1 minus the density of the surrounding fluid divided by the density of of the object so the mass of the block is 1,000 the density of the air which is the fluid is 1.29 and the density of ice is 917 so the apparent mass of this block of ice is about 998.50 kilogram per cubic meter so because the density of air is very low the apparent mass is very close to the true Mass it doesn't differ as much the difference is significant for objects that are light but objects that are very heavy with a very large density the difference is negligible but for light objects let's say like a a piece of paper then the upward Bo Force provided by air become significant now let's answer the second part of the question so let's say if you have a scale and you place a block of ice on top of it and the scale says that the block of ice is 4763 kilog now because is measured in air this is the apparent Mass it's not the true Mass so how can you calculate the true Mass knowing the density of air and the density of the block of ice so the apparent mass is 4763 we need to calculate M and PF is 1.29 and P is 9177 1 - 1.29 / 917 is about 99 8593 so 4763 divided by that number gives you a true mass of 476 97 kg so as you can see the true mass of the object is always going to be higher than the apparent Mass so whatever the scale reads know that the true mass is slightly higher than the apparent Mass let's try this word problem a 15 kgr block has an apparent mass of 12 kg when fully submerged in water what is the density of the block so we can use the apparent mass formula to calculate the density of an object submerge in a fluid of known density and we can also use it to calculate the density of an unknown fluid if we know the density of the object that is in the fluid so so let's rearrange this formula to calculate the density of the fluid and the object so let's divide both sides by m so ma a / m is equal to 1 minus PF over P now we're going to take this term which is negative on the right side we're going to move it to the left which is going to be positive on the left side and we're going to take this term which is positive on the left and move it to the right so it's going to be negative on the right side so PF / p is equal to 1 - ma / m o now let's multiply both sides by the density of the object so that uh these terms cancel so now we have this equation the density of the fluid is equal to the density of the object time 1us the apparent Mass / the actual mass now let's plug in what we have so we know that the density of the fluid which in this case for the first part it's water we're looking for the density of the block the apparent mass is 12 kg and the actual mass is 15 1 - 12 over 15 is about2 and 1,000 /2 is 5,000 so the density of the object is 5,000 kg per cubic meter so now that we know the density of the object let's calculate the density of the fluid so if we place the same object in an unknown fluid the apparent mass is found to be 10 kg what is the density of the unknown fluid so the density of the object is 5,000 the new apparent mass in this unknown fluid is 10 kg and the actual mass is 15 1 - 10 over 15 is about 33 33333 repeating time 5000 is equal to a density of 1667 kg per so that is a density of the unknown fluid let's work on this problem a 60 kgr block is attached to a rope connected to a vertical spring and a vacuum if the spring stretches 12 cmers to support the weight of the block what is the Spring's constant so a vertical spring can be used as a scale if you want to measure the weight of an object but first we need to know what the spring constant is so what you need to do first to measure the spring constant is you need to apply a block which you know the mass of so here we have a block of known Mass which is 60 kilg and so the weight force is going to cause the spring to stretch whenever you apply a downward Force to stretch a spring the spring wants to go back to its natural length there's an upward restoring force it turns out that the tension force that's in the Rope is equal to the force required to stretch the spring so those two are the same so what is the tension force in this problem if the net force in the y direction is equal to zero the upward tension force that supports the weight of the block has to equal the weight of the block and the tension force is basically the force required to Str stretch to Spring and according to Hook's law f is equal to KX and the weight force is mg now here's the question for you we know that X represents the amount that the spring is stretch from its equilibrium position and we have the value of x in centimeters so if we use 12 cenm K is going to be the spring constant in Newtons per centimeter should we keep X in centimet or should we convert it to meters and this problem really doesn't matter but it's best if we keep it in centimeters because when we answer the second part of the problem it's in centimeters as well so keep track of the units so X is 12 CM the mass is 60 kilogram and G is 9.8 so the weight force is 60 time 9.8 which is 588 Newtons and it stretches the spring by 12 CM so the spring constant is 49 Newtons per CM that means that a force of 49 Newtons will stretch the spring by 1 cm so therefore a force of 900 I mean of 588 Newtons will stretch the spring by 12 CM so now that we have the constant K we can use that to measure the mass of an unknown object now let's answer the second part of the problem so a cubical block of aluminum of unknown mass is attached to a vertical spring which stretches 54 cm in air so here's the spring and here's the Rope attached to the block so we have the downward weight force and the upward tension force that supports the weight of the block and the tension force is the same as the force required to stretch the spring and let's say this is the original natural length of the spring X is the amount that the spring is stretched by from its natural length so how can we calculate the mass of the block so once again once the block reaches equilibrium when it no longer stretches the spring the net force in the y direction is zero so the tension force equals the weight force and the tension force is basically the force required to stretch the spring which is KX and the weight force is mg so this time K is 49 Newtons per cm and X is now 54 cm so the unit centimeters will cancel given us the force in Newtons which is equal to the weave Force now keep in mind this is an air it's no longer in a vacuum so the mass that we're going to calculate is not the true Mass it represents the apparent Mass the reason why that's the case is due to the fact that air is a fluid whenever you have an object placed in a fluid there is an upward Bo force in a vacuum there is no upward Bo Force so the tension is equal to the true weight of the object but in the fluid the tension equals the apparent weight so the apparent mass times the gravitational acceleration is really the apparent weight so what is the apparent weight equal to well for this object to be in equilibrium the sum of the forces must be equal to zero meaning the upward tension force plus the upward B Force minus the downward weight force is equal to zero so if you solve for tension T is equal to the true weight minus the bo Force so since T which is equal to the apparent weight that apparent weight is the true weight minus the B Force but for this particular problem we don't have to worry about all that what we need to understand is that the tangent force is equal to the apparent weight and not the true weight which means that the tension force is equal to the apparent masstimes the gravitational acceleration once we understand that we can find the apparent mass and then using the other formula we can calculate the true Mass so let's find the apparent Mass so it's going to be the spring constant 49 times the amount that the spring is stretched by which is 54 cm that's equal to the apparent weight which is 2646 Newtons divid 9.8 and so the apparent mass is equal to 270 kg so that's how you can calculate the apparent mass of an object used in a vertical spring you need to know the spring constant and you need to measure with a ruler how much the spring stretches by and you can calculate the spring constant using a block of known mass and see how much it changes by and then you could find the mass of an unknown object so now that we have the apparent Mass let's use this equation apparent mass is equal to the true Mass * 1 - PF / P so the apparent mass is 270 the mass of the the density of the fluid is uh 1.29 because it's an air and the density of the object is 2700 So 1 - 1.29 / 2700 it's roughly about 1 it's like 999 5222 so 270 divided by that number is about 27013 so in air the true mass is very close to the apparent Mass They Don't Really differ by that much so now that we know the true mass and the apparent Mass how far will the spring stretch if 40% of the aluminum block is submerged in water so let's draw a new picture so let's say if we have a tank containing water and naturally if you place aluminum in water aluminum is more dense so it's going to sink to the bottom but if we attach a rope to it then it won't sink the upper tension force will support the weight of the object and it's still attached to a spring now only 40% of the aluminum block is so emerged in water so we're still going to have a downward weave Force but now we have an upward boin Force provided by the water as well there's also an upward brain Force provided by the air as well so what we're going to do is we're going to calculate the amount that this spring will stretch neglecting air and also useing air so first let let's neglect the effects of air let's just look at the contribution of the buoyant force just by water alone now we know that there's an upward tension force which is equal to the force required to stretch the spring so we got to find out what Delta X is which we could just simply say x so feel free to pause the video and determine the the distance that the spring will stretch if 40% of the aluminum block is submerged in water so to calculate the amount that the spring will stretch we need to calculate the tension force because that tension force is the force that's pulling on the spring which is equal to KX we know the value of K it's 49 Newtons per CM so if we can calculate the tension force then we could find X X so how can we calculate the tension force so we know that the tension force is equal to the weight Force minus the bo Force the weight force is mg and we know the true Mass which is I'm going to write it on a side 2703 kg and then minus the buyant force which is the density of the fluid times the volume of the object that is submerged times the gravitational acceleration so we know the density of the fluid that's a th so we need to find the volume that is submerged so what is the volume of the cube how can we calculate that answer now we know that mass is equal to density time volume so if you want to solve for volume volume it's Mass / density now the volume of the object that is submerge is 40% of the aluminum block so that's 04 times the volume of the entire object and we know that the volume of the entire object is basically the mass of that object divided by the density of the object so now we can calculate the volume that is submerged so vs is equal to4 time the mass of the object which the true mass is 27013 divided by the density of the aluminum block which is 2700 kilog per cubic meter so 27013 divided by 2700 So the volume of the aluminum block is about 0.1 kilog per cubic meter multiplied by4 so the volume that is submerged it's about 04 0 02 so now that we have the volume submerged we can now calculate the tension force so it's going to be the mg which is 27013 * 9.8 minus the bo force due to water which is the density of water times the volume submerged which is 04002 time G which is 9.8 so the weight of the object 27013 * 9.8 that's about 2,647 3 minus the upward Bo Force caused by the displacement of water that's 1,00 * 042 * 9.8 and that's about so if we subtract these two numbers the tension force is equal to 22551 newtons so the tension force is equal to KX where K is 49 new per centimeter so 22 55.1 / 49 is equal to 46 CM so that's how far the spring will stretch if the aluminum block is partially submerged so notice that it stretches 54 cm in air but in water it's only going to stretch 46 CM because water supports the weight of the aluminum block by means of the upward bant Force so it's going to be less than 54 now if we take into account the upward buyant force of air the amount that the spring stretches SP should be even less right now it's 46.2 so that is the current answer if we don't take into account air but now let's take into account the effects of air so this is the Bo force due to water now we must also subtract the bo force due to air let's call it fb2 so keep in mind W minus FB is 22 55.1 now we need to subtract it by the bo force due to air to get the new tension force now the new buyant force due to air is equal to the density of the air times the volume of the object submerged in air time G so let's find the volume of the object's emerging air so if 40% is below water 60% is above water so we need to find 60% of the volume of the object and the volume of the object we know is the mass of the object divided by the density of the object so it's 6 * the mass of the object which is 2 70.3 / the density of aluminum which is 2700 So the volume that is submerged is about 06003 so now let's calculate the boing force due to air so the density of the air is 1.29 and the volume of the object submerged in air as we said it's 06 003 and G is 9.8 so the bo force due to air is very very small even negligible it's about 76 Newtons so the tension force is 22 55.1 that's without air but due to the bo force of air it's now going to be 22 54. 34 Newtons so this tension force is equal to KX because it's used to stretch the spring so let's divide it by 49 so due to the effects of air the spring will stretch by a distance of 46.7 CM so the difference is minute but there's still a difference either case the spring will stretch by 46 CM whether you take into account air or if you choose not to take into account a block of Von is attached to a spherical balloon of radius 10 m that is filled with helium so let's say this is the balloon and attached to it we have a block of iron the radius of the balloon is 10 m and it contains helium we also have the mass of the skin of the balloon what is the upward buoyant force act in on the balloon The Bu force is equal to the density of the fluid in this case the surrounded fluid is the air around the balloon times the volume of the balloon which is the volume of the object submerged in the fluid time G the density of the air is simply 1.29 the volume of balloon is 4 over3 pi r Cub or Pi * 10 the 3 power time G 10 3 is 1,000 * 4 piun / 3 * 1.29 * 9.8 the upward buyant force acting on the balloon is 52,000 955 Newtons now that we have the upward Bo Force let's go ahead and calculate the mass of iron that the balloon can support so the upward Bo Force has to support the weight force of iron and must also support the weight of the helium that's inside the balloon and also it has to support the weight of the balloon itself because the structure of the balloon has mass so therefore the upward Bo force is equal to the weight of the load or the iron block plus the weight of the helium particles inside balloon plus the weight of the balloon structure itself so the bo Force which is 52955 which for now I'm going to write it as P of the fluid time the volume time G that's equal to the weight of the load which is the mass of the iron load time G plus the weight of helium which is the mass of helium time G plus the weight of the block so we could divide everything by G so we have the density of the air times the volume which equals the mass of the load now the mass of helium is equal to the density of the helium gas times the volume of the balloon plus the mass of the balloon so what can we do to solve for the missing variable now at this point let's plug in everything that we have but let's move this and this term to the other side so the density of the airtimes the volume of the balloon minus the density of helium time the volume minus the mass of the balloon equals the mass of the iron load so let's take out V so now we can solve for M so the volume of the balloon is 4 over3 Pi * the radius to the 3 power the density of the air is 1.29 minus the density of helium which is79 minus the mass mass of the balloon which is 125 so the mass of the load once you type this information in it's 4529 kg now that we have that information what is the buyant force acted on the block of iron because the block of iron is also displacing air as well so the air is going to exert an upward Bo Force however the volume of the block of iron is insignificant so chances are we can neglect it but let's go ahead and calculate the bo force acting on the block of iron so that Bo force is going to be the density of the fluid which is the density of the air times the volume of the block of iron which displaces the air time G now we don't have the volume of R but we do know the mass and we do know the density so if mass is density time volume volume is mass divid density so the blant force acting on the block of iron is the density of the air times the mass of the block of iron which is 45 29 ID the density which is 7800 * G so the bo force acting on the block of iron it's about 7.34 Newtons now keep in mind the bo force that was acting on the balloon was 52,900 balloon and the reason for that is the volume of the balloon is so much more larger than the volume of the block of iron and so that's why we could ignore this Bo Force the next thing that we need to talk about is the mass flow rate the mass flow rate is the amount of mass that passes through a certain point per unit time so it's the change in mass divided by the change in time now we know that mass is density time volume so the change in mass is the density times the change in volume now let's say if we have a pipe which is in the shape of a cylinder we know that the volume of a cylinder isk r s time height so the volume of the cylinder is the area of the circle which isk r^ 2 time the height which is basically the length of the pipe so the change in volume is the area times the change in height the change in height is basically the displacement displacement divided by time is equal to Velocity D over T is equal to V so therefore we could say that the mass flow rate is equal to the density time the area time the velocity so if the mass flow rate is equal to density time area time velocity how can we calculate the volume flow rate to find the volume flow rate multiply both sides by 1 over P Mass ID density is volume we know that m is equal to PV so if you divide by P Mass over density is volume so Delta M over p is Delta V so the volume flow rate is basically the area times the velocity now let's work on some problems based on the equations that we just came up with so water flows through a circular pipe that has a diameter of 20 cm and it flows through the pipe at a speed of 3 m/ second so what is the mass flow rate so the mass flow rate is equal to the density of the fluid times the cross-sectional area times the velocity so the cross-sectional area is basically pi r 2 since it's the area of a circle so if the diameter is 20 cm the radius is 10 cm but in meters if you divide by 100 that's .1 M so it's going to be the density which is 1,00 * piun * R 2 multipli by the speed of 3 m/ second so so the mass flow rate is about 9425 kg per second so what this means is that every second 94.25% what mass of water will enter a storage tank in 2 hours so let's say this is the storage tank and water flows out of the pipe into the storage tank so after 2 hours how many kilograms of water will enter the storage tank so we know the mass flow rate is 94.25% second so what we need to do is convert hours into seconds so we know that there's 60 minutes in an hour and also there's 60 seconds in a minute so 2 hours is about 7200 seconds so if we take the time in seconds and multiply by the mass flow rate the unit seconds will cancel and we can get the total mass that's going to flow into the tank in 2 hours so it's 7200 seconds multiplied by 94.25% second so in 2 hours 678 600 kg of water is going to flow into the tank now what about the last part of the question how long will it take to add 25,000 kg of water to the tank so we're given mass and we need to find the time you can use an equation or you can simply use units to get the answer let's start with the mass and kilog so we have 25,000 kilg and we want to converted to some unit of time so now we know the mass flow rate which we set it to be 9425 kg per second so in 1 second 94.25% and let's see if minutes is an appropriate unit so if we want the answer in seconds 25,000 ided 94.25% to enter into the tank at this rate let's try another problem so water flows through a circular pipe of radius 8 cm so that's uh this distance here and it flows through this pipe at a speed of 2.5 m/s what is the volume flow rate the volume flow rate change in V / change in T is equal to the crosssectional area of the pipe times the velocity so the cross-sectional area is the area of a circle which is pi * the radius squar 8 cm is basically 08 M squar time the speed which is 2.5 m/s so the volume flow rate is about 05 03 cubic m/ second so as you can see here we have square met time met to the first Power 2 + 1 is 3 now that we have the volume flow rate how long will it take to fill a pool if the dimensions are 10x 4X 15 so first we need to calculate the volume of the pool which is length time width time height 10 * 4 * 15 is about 600 cubic M so now that we have the volume and the volume flow rate we can calculate the time so let's start with the volume which is six 00 cubic M and we know that in 1 second a volume of 0503 cubic met of water is going to flow through the pipe into the pool so notice that the volume cancels the cubic meters so right now this is going to give us the time in seconds but it's going to be a pretty large number so let's convert it to minutes now we know that there's 60 seconds in a minute and also there's 60 Minutes in a single hour so these units will cancel and those units will cancel 600 ID 503 is about 11,928 seconds ID by 60 that's divid by another 60 this is going to give us a time of 3.3 hours so that's how long it's going to take to fill a pool with water if the volume of the pool is 600 cubic M now there's some other stuff that you need to know let's say if we have another circular pipe and let's call this position a and position B the rate at which water flows into the pipe at a equals the rate at which water leaves the pipe at B and this is associated with the equation of continuity so the mass flow rate at position a is equal to the mass flow rate at position B and the mass flow rate is basically the density times the area times the velocity so this equation is useful if a fluid can be compressed if you have a compressible fluid like a gas the density can change so let's say if the area is constant but if the density increases that means that the velocity has to decrease and let's say if the density is constant if density is constant you can cancel these two terms and then you get another equation which is A1 * V1 and that's equal to A2 * V2 the area times the velocity as you mentioned is the volume flow rate so if the density is the same that means that you have an incompressible fluid if the density is constant so for incompressible fluids the volume flow rate is constant so if you increase the area the velocity will decrease and if you decrease the area the velocity will increase so let's say if we increase the area so let's say uh A1 has an area of 2 cm squar and A2 has an area that's twice the value let's say it's 4 square cm so if the velocity that enters this cross-sectional area is 5 m/s what is the velocity that leaves this pipe so what's V2 so if we use the equation A1 V1 is equal to A2 V2 A1 is 2 V1 is 5 A2 is four so let's find V2 so it's 2 * 5 which is 10 / 4 that's 2.5 so if you increase the area by a factor of two from 2 to 4 then the velocity will decrease by a factor of two so as you increase the area the velocity decreases proportionally now let's say if we decrease the area let's say if the radius is 10 cm and let's say over here the radius is now 5 cm if the velocity that enters the pipe let's say it's 10 m per second what is the velocity that leaves this uh smaller section so what's V2 if we have V1 so using the same equation A1 V1 is equal to A2 V2 but this time we have the radius of the of the pipe at these two points so for circle area is pi r 2 now we can cancel pi and we don't have to convert centimeters into meters because we have a ratio and as long as R1 and R2 are both in centimeters the units will cancel and it's going to work so R1 is 10 cm V1 is 10 R2 is 5 and let's solve for v2 so 10^ 2 * 10 is 1,00 / 5^ s which is 25 1,000 ID 25 gives you a velocity or speed of 40 m/s so if we reduce the radius by a factor of two the velocity increases by a factor four because the velocity is inversely related to the square of the radius so if you decrease the radius by two 2^ s is 4 the speed will increase by factor four if you decrease the radius by three 3^ s is 9 the speed will increase by a factor of n so in this case let's say if R1 was 10 over 3 cm then the speed will be 10 * 9 it's going to be 90 m/s now what about the pressure what happens to the pressure as the speed increases from 10 to 40 now according to Bern's principle wherever the velocity of the fluid is high the pressure is low and where the velocity is low the pressure is high so on the left side the speed or the velocity is very low so the pressure is high and on the right side the speed is high so the pressure must be low now it makes sense whenever you have a pressure there is a force because pressure is force over area so on the left side if we have a region of high pressure there must be a very large force that accelerates the fluid towards the right and on the right side we have a low pressure so the force that is created by that pressure is weak so notice that this force is greater than this one so therefore there's a net force that accelerates the fluid towards the right and so it speeds up from 10 m/s to 40 m/s so the potential energy that's stored in the form of this high pressure is converted to kinetic energy as the pressure reduces so as the pressure decreases es from high to low it loses potential energy and the water molecules they gain kinetic energy and so they speed up and as you can see in order for the mass flow rate to be the same the water has to flow faster in its confined space so that the amount of water that enters the pipe equals the amount of water that leaves the pipe now if we wish to calculate how the pressure changes along a pipe we need to use Bern's equation and bui's equation comes from the conservation of energy so let's say if we have the same situation and the pipe accelerates due to the cross-sectional area decreasing so there's a velocity V1 and and increases to a velocity V2 and we have a pressure P1 and a pressure P2 so if there's a change in pressure there going to be a net force which accelerates the fluid so the work done by this net force should be equal to the change in kinetic energy and the change in kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy minus the initial kinetic energy so work plus the initial kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy and the work done by a force is is that Force which is basically the net force times the displacement and the initial kinetic energy is 12 mv1 2 and the final kinetic energy is 12 mv2 2 now we know that pressure is force divided by area so if you multiply both sides by a the pressure times the area is equal to the force so we can replace f with pressure time area time the displacement plus 12 mv1 2 = 12 mv2 2 so at this point what we're going to do is divide everything by the volume area time displacement equals volume let's say if you have have a cylinder and it has an area a and a displacement or height of D then the volume is equal to a the volume of a cylinder is the area which is p piun r squ that's the area of a circle and the vertical or the horizontal displacement is basically the height of the cylinder so volume equals a so we have pressure we're going to replace a with uh volume which is divided by volume plus 12 m / V Mass / volume is density so we get this equation and V will cancel so the pressure plus 12 p v1^2 is equal to 12 p v2^ 2 and I do have to make a correction because four equals pressure time area but the net force is really the difference in two forces it's the difference between F1 and FS2 so the net force it's really FS1 minus FS2 which is P1 a minus P2 a so if you take out a the that force is a * P1 minus P2 which is basically a * the change in pressure so this should be Delta P by the way so change in pressure plus 12 pv1 s is equal to 12 pv2 2 and Delta P we said it's uh P1 minus P2 so if we add P2 to both sides of the equation we're going to get this form of the equation now what if the height changes because sometimes the pipe needs to go to a different elevated position so let's say this is the pressure P1 this is the pressure P2 and we have a fluid moving at a speed V1 and here at a speed V2 so the pressure has to apply a force to lift up the fluid Against Gravity and anytime the height of the fluid is changing the gravitational potential energy is changing changing so over here the pressure has to be high and here the pressure is low assuming if the velocity is the same as well so the energy stored in the high pressure will be converted to gravitational potential energy to lift up the object or to lift up the fluid to a higher position so as energy so energy is going to be transferred from pressure pressure to gravitational potential energy as the fluid goes up so the work done by the difference in pressure is equal to the change in mechanical energy the reason being is depending on the difference in pressure the pressure could increase the speed as well which really depends on the relative difference between A1 and A2 the are the cross-sectional area of the pipe so if the area increases the speed is going to increase so the pressure can be used to speed up the fluid or it can Elevate the fluid to a different height so the kinetic energy of the fluid can change and also the gravitational potential energy can change the mechanical energy is basically the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy so if work equals change in mechanical energy in this particular situation then it equals the final mechanical energy minus the initial mechanical energy so work plus initial mechanical energy is equal to the final mechanical energy and the initial mechanical energy is basically the initial kinetic energy plus the initial gravitational potential energy and that's equal to the final kinetic energy plus the final potential energy so P1 is going to exert a force F1 and P2 will exert a backward Force called FS2 so the work is basically the net force times the displacement and the net force is the difference between these two forces so it's fub1 minus FS2 D and we know that force is basically pressure time area so it's P1 a minus P2 a * D and if we factor out a it's going to be a * P1 minus P2 time D so let's replace W with the area times the change in pressure time D initial kinetic energy is 12 M v1^2 and initial gravitational potential energy is MGH H1 and that's equal to final kinetic energy which is 12 mv2 2 plus final potential energy which is MGH H2 so now what we're going to do is replace area times displacement with uh volume so ad is basically volume time P1 minus P2 plus uh everything else which I guess I could just copy this now let's divide everything on both sides of the equation by the volume so these two cancel so it's P1 minus P2 plus Mass over volume is density so it's 12 density * v1^2 plus density time gh1 which equals 12 P2 v2^ 2 plus PG H2 2 or just PGH H2 and now we're going to take this and add it to the other side so now we have br's equation P1 + 12 P V1 2 plus PGH H1 is equal to 12 P2 v2^ 2 or just p v2^ 2 plus p G H2 plus pressure 2 so that's beni's equation it helps you to see how pressure changes when the height changes or when the speed of the fluid changes so let's review how this is going to work so let's say if as we mentioned before if the speed increases so let's say this is V1 and this is V2 whenever the speed increases the pressure is going to decrease so if it's moving slow at the left and if it's moving fast on the right side whenever the fluid is moving slow the pressure is high and whenever the fluid is moving fast the pressure is low so you need need a high pressure to accelerate the fluid to increase the speed whenever the speed increases there's an acceleration which means that there's a net force and the net force created by a fluid is usually due to uh pressure differences so as the pressure changes from high to low the speed is going to increase if of course the cross-sectional area decreases because as the area decreases the velocity will increase and the pressure will decrease now let's say if we have a pipe and the height decreases so let's say this is P1 P2 but the cross-sectional area is the same so that means that V1 is going to equal V2 if uh A1 equals A2 so therefore the velocity is constant now whenever an object travels from a high position to a low position gravitational potential energy is being released so the question is what is absorbing that gravitational potential energy because typically when an object slides down an incline the gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy and so the object speeds up so if the cross-sectional area is the same according to the volume flate equation if A1 equal A2 V1 equal V2 if the fluid is incompressible so if the fluid density doesn't change the velocity has to be the same which means that the kinetic energy is the same so where does that gravitational potential energy go if kinetic energ is same at this position the pressure is low but now the pressure is high so whenever a fluid falls from a high position to a low position the pressure increases the gravitational potential energy is being transferred to another form of potential energy which is stored in the form of high pressure so whenever you have a fluid at high pressure that fluid is capable of doing work because once that pressure changes from high to low there's going to be a net force and whenever there's a net force work can be done energy can be transferred because force times displacement is work so as the fluid travels from a high position to a low position the gravitational potential energy is being converted in the form of pressure so the pressure increases likewise if the fluid um flows from a high position or rather from a low position to a high position the energy that's stored in the form of high pressure is going to be released to push up the fluid to a higher position so pressure energy is being converted to gravitational potential energy so let's see if we can put this information a good use so let's say this is point a point B Point C and point D let's see how the pressure changes as the fluid moves through through this uh pipe now let's review the basic rules we know that if the cross-sectional area decreases the fluid is going to speed up the velocity is going to increase and whenever the velocity increases if the speed is high and the pressure is low so the pressure decreases and this is at constant height now let's say if the area is the same that means velocity or the speed is going to be the same now if the height decreases the pressure will increase and if the height increases the pressure will decrease so now let's go through this problem as the fluid flows from position a to position B the crosssection area decreases which means that the velocity of the fluid increases so that means that the pressure decreases so if a is at high pressure B is at a relatively low pressure compared to a so now let's compare B and C so the cross-section or area from B to C is the same so which means that the velocity is going to be the same but the height is changing so the position is decreasing so gravitational potential energy is being converted to pressure energy which means that the pressure is going to increase so C is at a higher pressure relative to position B now what about position D the cross-sectional area increases so if the cross-sectional area increases then that means that the velocity has to decrease and according to bui's principle whenever the speed is low the the pressure is high so the pressure increases so D is at a higher pressure relative to C now let's work on some problems so let's say if we have a pipe and the crosssectional area decreases let's say the pressure at position a is50 kilopascals or 150,000 pascals what is the pressure at B if if the cross-sectional area at a let's say it's 30 square cm and A2 is 15 square cm and let's also say that the velocity at position a let's say it's 4 m/s so with this information if you have V1 P1 A1 and A2 what is P2 how would you calculate the pressure at position B so feel free to pause the video so the first thing we need to do is calculate V2 using the volume flate equation A1 V1 is equal to A2 V2 so this equation is true if the fluid is incompressible where the density is the same so A1 is 30 cm V1 is 4 a 2 is 15 what's V2 so if the area decreases by a factor of two from 30 to 15 the speed should increase by a factor of two from 4 to 8 30 divide well 30 * 4 divid 15 gives you 8 so that is the velocity at position B so now that we know the velocity we can calculate the pressure using Bern's equation so so P1 + pgh1 + 12 p v1^2 is equal to P2 plus pgh2 + 12 pv2 2 now the height of the center of the fluid is the same so the gravitational potential energy doesn't change so energy from pressure is being converted to kinetic energy so P2 has to be lower than P1 because the speed is increasing whenever the velocity is high the pressure is low so let's calculate P2 so P1 is 150,000 pascals now we're going to use water so the density of water is 1,000 kilg per cubic meter the velocity at position a is four we're looking for P2 and V2 is 8 4 is 16 * .5 that's 8 * 1,000 so this is 8,000 pascals and 8^2 is 64 half of that is 32 * 1 th000 so over here this is is 32,000 so 150,000 + 8,000 - 32,000 gives you a pressure value of 126,000 so as the speed increased from 4 m/s to 8 m/s the pressure decreased from 150,000 pascals to 126 6,000 pascals so notice that the pressure doesn't change proportionally so to speak even though the speed doubled the pressure didn't it wasn't reduced by half it decreased but it wasn't exactly by half so anytime the speed increases the pressure decreases now let's try another problem so let's say the cross-sectional area is 10 square cm and at A2 the cross-sectional area is the same and let's say the fluid is moving at a speed of 5 m/ Second and also since the cross-sectional area is the same the speed is the same now let's say the pressure at P1 or at position a let's say it's 150,000 pascals and the height difference between these two positions let's say it's uh 5 m what is the pressure P2 so as you mentioned before anytime the area is the same the speed will be the same so the pressure energy is being converted to gravitational potential energy anytime the height of the fluid increases the pressure is going to decrease assuming the speed remains constant so how can we calculate P2 so let's start with boni's equation now since the velocity is constant V1 equals V2 so we can eliminate this term P1 is 150,000 pascals times PGH the gauge pressure now we're going to say that this is ground level so position a is at a height of zero if that's at ground level so this disappears P2 we looking for that and then PGH the density of water time G which is 9.8 time the height position B is 5 m above the reference level so 1,00 * 9.8 * 5 is about 49,000 so P2 is 150,000 minus 49,000 so P2 is about 101,000 so as we can see because the height increased the pressure decreased from 150,000 pascals to 101,000 pascals now it turns out that there's two ways to increase the speed of the fluid one way is for the fluid to decrease in height if the object decreases in height it can speed up meaning the gravitational potential energy can convert to kinetic energy the other way to speed up the fluid is to decrease the pressure If you decrease the potential energy stored in the form of pressure it can be converted to kinetic energy and the fluid can speed up and as we know if the height decreases the pressure can increase sometimes now let's say if the gravitational potential energy decreases by 200w so basically the height is decreasing now sometimes this decrease in height can increase the pressure and it can increase the speed for example if the energy stored in pressure goes up by 120 Jew that means that the kinetic energy which is Quantified by the speed and the mass must go up by 80 Jew so a decrease in height is capable of increasing the pressure and the kinetic energy but now let's say if the height decreases and the gravitational potential energy as a result decreases by 200 jewles but sometimes the kinetic energy can increase more than the amount that the gravitational potential energy decreased by now let's say if the potential energy decreases by 200 Jew but the kinetic energy increases by 300 Jew how is that possible the only way that the kinetic energy can increase by a magnitude greater than the potential energy is that the pressure has to decrease so if the pressure loses 100 jewles of energy that 100 jewles is transferred to kinetic and the 200 jewles lost by the gravitational potential energy is also transferred to kinetic energy so if the the speed increases by a lot the height and the pressure could both decrease so you have multiple situations that you can deal with here but let's illustrate this example so let's say if we have another pipe and the height decreases but also the cross-sectional area increases so let's say the cross-sectional area is 10 square cm and at this position the cross-sectional area doubles to 20 square cm and let's say the pressure is 200 kilopascals or 200,000 pascals and the speed let's say it's currently 10 m/s so that's V1 so we need to calculate V2 the new speed and we want to calculate P2 and let's say the height difference between these two positions let's say it changes by 10 m so first let's find a new speed if if the cross-sectional area doubles well actually I don't want it to double I want it to decrease so the speed can increase so let's say the new cross-sectional area is five so if the cross-sectional area is reduced by a half that means the speed has to increase it has to double so the speed is 20 m/s according to the equation A1 V1 equal A2 V2 so if the area decreases the speed increases so we know the kinetic energy is increasing now let's calculate the new pressure so P1 plus P1 or just p v^ 2 12 P V1 2 plus p g H1 is equal to P2 +2 p v2^ 2 plus PGH H2 so let's say this is the reference level so H2 is zero P1 is 200,000 plus 12 the density of the fluid which we'll use water * V1 2 or 10^ 2 plus P * G time H1 which is 10 m above the reference level equal P2 + 12 P * V2 or 20 2 10 s is 100 * 1,000 * .5 so this is 50 ,000 and 1,000 * 9.8 * 10 is 98,000 and 20 2 * 1,000 * .5 is 200,000 plus P2 so these two cancel which means P2 is basically 50,000 plus 98,000 so P2 is now 148,000 so now let's think about what happens here now what do you think happened so we know that the speed increased which means that the kinetic energy of the fluid went up but notice that the gravitational potential energy decrease because the fluid it decreased in height and also the pressure decreased from 200,000 to 148,000 now just because the height decreases it doesn't always mean that the pressure will increase if the speed was constant then the pressure has to increase if the height decreases but in this case the increase in kinetic energy exceeded the decrease in gravitational potential energy so in order to increase the kinetic energy further the pressure had to decrease as well so let's say if the change in height wasn't 10 m let's say if it's 20 so let's say if the decrease in gravitational potential energy was significant what's going to happen now so P1 which is 200,000 pass G Plus PGH that's 1,000 * G time the new height difference of 20 m not centimet plus 12 pv^ 2 or 1000 * 10 m/s s this is equal to P2 pgh2 is zero because it's going to be at the reference level plus 12 p v2^ 2 so we know this is 20,000 which is going to cancel with this number so P2 is going to be 1,000 * 9.8 * 20 which is 196,000 plus 1,00 * 10^ 2 * which is 50,000 so if we add those two numbers we could see that P2 is 246,000 pascals now notice that the pressure is higher than what it was before in the last example it was lower than what it was before 4 so in this case because we increase the change in height because it's 20 M and not 10 m the decrease in gravitational potential energy was more than enough to increase the kinetic energy and so that extra decrease in gravitational potential energy was used to increase the pressure so whenever the height decreases the pressure will increase if the speed is constant if the speed is not constant the pressure can increase or it can decrease depending on the relative changes in potential and kinetic energy so if the speed were to increase by let's say a small amount the pressure will increase as well however if the height decreases and if if the speed is to increase by a large amount the pressure has to decrease to also contribute to the increase of that speed and therefore the kinetic energy so if the speed changes the pressure may or may not increase the pressure is most likely to increase if the speed increases by a small amount but if the speed increases by a large amount the pressure has to decrease so it helps to think of the energy changes so let's say if the gravitational potential energy decreases by 500w if the kinetic energy increases by an amount that's less than a gravitational potential energy let's say 400 then the pressure energy has to go up by 100 so in this case the decrease in height cause the speed to increase by a small amount so the pressure is going to increase by a small amount now let's say if the potential energy decreases by 500 Jew but this time the kinetic energy increases by a large amount an amount that's greater than the decrease of the potential energy so let's say the kinetic energy increases by 700 jewles to support that increase the pressure has to go down by 200 Jew so in this case since the height decreased and since the velocity increased by an amount that's greater than the height the pressure has to decrease so let's summarize what we've just considered and consider the relative sizes of the arrows so if the height decreases and if the speed increases by an amount that's less than a decrease of the height then the pressure has to increase as well so notice that the height of these two arrows is equal to the the height of that Arrow let's make this a little bit bigger so now let's say if the height decreases but the speed increases by an amount that's greater than a decrease in the height in this case the pressure has to decrease as well to support the increase of the speed so that's how you can tell if pressure is going to go up or if it's going to go down when the height decreases and if the height decreases but if velocity doesn't change then the pressure has to go up by an amount that's equal to the decrease in the gravitational potential energy so now you know how to tell if the pressure is going to go up or if it's going to go down so anytime the speed is constant if the height decreases pressure goes up if the height decreases and the speed increases by a small amount the pressure will go up if the height decreases but if the speed increases by a larger amount greater than a decrease of the height then the pressure is going to go down to support the increase in speed so hopefully that makes sense try this problem so let's say if we have a similar situation let's say that the area is 2 cm squ and over here the area is 4 cm squ and let's say the velocity V1 is currently 2 m/s at a pressure of 300 kilopascals now let's say the height difference is 5 m so if the area let's reduce the area rather than increasing it let's say the area is 1 square cm so if the area reduces by a factor of two what is the new velocity so if we decrease the area by two we know the velocity is going to double calculate P2 so we know it's going to be 300,000 pascals plus 12 the density times the velocity squar plus PGH and that's equal to pgh2 which is 0 plus P2 + 12 * 1,00 * 4^ 2 if you solve for P2 you should get 343,000 so notice that the pressure increased now let's say if you decrease the area to an even lower amount let's say that the area is decreased to let's say it decreases by a factor of four so it's a 05 squar if it decreases by a factor of four that actually let's say it decreases by a factor of eight let's say it's 0 25 what's the new velocity if it decreases by that amount so if it decreases by a factor of 8 the velocity should increase by a factor of 8 2 * 8 is 16 so notice that the speed increases by a large amount calculate the new pressure so it's going to be P1 which is 300,000 pascals plus 12 PV ^ 2 plus PGH and pgh2 is0 plus P2 + 12 PV ^ 2 so 1,000 * 9.8 * 5 is 49,000 2^ 2 is 4 * 1,000 which is 4,000 * half that's 2,000 so 2,000 + 49,000 that's 51,000 + 300,000 the entire left side is 351,000 16 * 1,000 * .5 is 128,000 so P2 is 351,000 minus 128,000 which is 223,000 or 223 kPa so as you can see as the height decreased and when the velocity increased by a small amount the pressure went up from 300 kilopascals to 343 now when the height decreased by the same amount but when the velocity increased by a large amount notice that the pressure went down from 300 kPa to 223 kPa because the kinetic energy of the system increased by a lot the decrease in gravitational potential energy was not enough to support the increase in kinetic energy so the potential energy stored in the form of pressure had to go down now let's consider the reverse situation let's say that the pipe goes up this time and the cross-sectional area decreases how will the pressure change will the pressure increase or decrease so since the area is decreasing that means that the velocity has to increase which means that the kinetic energy of the system has to go up the velocity has to increase if the volume flow rate is to remain constant meaning that the fluid is incompressible the density remain the same so if the velocity goes up kinetic energy has to go up now the height is increasing which means that the gravitational potential energy is increasing as well so what has to happen to pressure in order for the kinetic energy to go up and the potential energy to go up so pressure has to decrease the potential energy stored in the form of pressure has to go down in order that the gravitational potential energy can go up and the kinetic energy can go up so here the fluid is moving at a high speed and here it's moving at a low speed so therefore the pressure has to be high and here the pressure is low so the pressure decreases so if the height increases the pressure has to decrease to support the increase in height and if the speed increases the pressure has to decrease even more to support the increase in speed so in order for these two forms of energy to go up pressure has to go down now let's say if the area increases rather than decreasing as the fluid TR travels upward so if the area increases that means that velocity has to decrease and if the speed is decreasing the kinetic energy has to decrease now we know that height is increasing which means that the gravitational potential energy has to be increasing so the pressure is it increasing or decreasing so it depends so here are two scenarios let's say if let's say if the change in kinetic energy is greater than the change in potential energy gravitational potential energy and in the other situation the change in kinetic is less than the change in potential so if the change in kinetic energy is greater than the change in potential energy will the pressure have to increase or decrease now let's use numbers so if the change in kinetic energy is greater let's say that the kinetic energy decreases by 300 Jew that means the potential energy has to go up by something that's less than 300 so let's say the potential energy goes up by 200 that means that the pressure has to go up by 100 -300 is opposite to positive 300 if-300 Jew of energy was lost by means of kinetic energy then if 200 Jew were were gained by potential energy then the other 100 has to show up as an increase in pressure so if the decrease in kinetic energy exceeds the increase in potential energy the pressure has to go up now if the change in kinetic energy is less than the change in potential energy the pressure has to go down now it helps if you put numbers to it so let's say if the kinetic energy decreased by 400w and it if the gravitational potential energy increase or change more than that let's say it changeed by 700 Jew then to support the increase in potential energy the pressure has to decrease by 300 so this is negative negative and positive so the change in energy is zero here if you add these three values energy is conserved the change in energy is zero now let's say if you have a tank filled with water and there is an opening let's say this is the height of the water and you want to find out the velocity of water that shoots out of this tank and let's say the height of water above that position let's say it's 20 M how can you calculate the velocity of water that flows out using T term the equation that you need is velocity is equal to theare root of 2 G there's many ways in which you can get this equation one way is to realize that because the height of the water is decreasing the potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy the Press pressure inside here is basically a vacuum and the pressure outside here is a vacuum too is basically the atmospheric pressure so there's really no change in pressure the height is decreasing and that change in gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic so PE is equal to K so MGH is equal to 12 mv^2 so you can cancel M and then if you multiply both sides by 2 2 G is equal to V ^2 and if you square root it the velocity is simply the square root of 2 G so it's going to be the square root of 2 * 9.8 times the difference in uh in height between uh these two points and this is going to give you a speed of 19.8 m/s now you can use Bern's equation to get get the same result so you want to calculate the velocity and let's draw the picture again so right now the rate at which the velocity or the height of this fluid is decreasing is very slow so we could say V1 is approximately zero we're looking for v2 now let's say this is the reference level let's say that's ground level the height difference is basically H1 H2 is basically going to be zero if we choose that to be the reference level so we can get rid of this portion of the equation and once the water exits the opening it's basically exposed to the atmosphere which has a pressure of 10 1.3 kPa and if this surface is open too the pressure there is equal to the atmospheric pressure which is 101 kPa so these are the same they cancel so now what we have left over is the gauge pressure pgh1 is equal to 12 P1 or just P V1 squ which is basically the gauge pressure is associated with the gravitational potential energy mg MGH and that's this this pressure here is associated with the kinetic energy of the fluid which is 1 12 mv^2 so we can cancel the density the same way we can cancel the mass and then GH is equal to 12 V ^2 so if you multiply both sides by two 2 2 G is equal to v^2 and if you take the sare root the velocity is equal to theare root of 2 G so using Bern's equation or simply using the conservation of energy you're going to get this equation so if you increase the height of the water tank the speed at which water flows out of that tank will increase let's try this problem water at a pressure of 9 ATM flows into a building at ground level at 3.2 m/s through a pipe 8 cm in diameter the pipe Rises 15 M high and decreases to 3.5 cm in diameter what is the velocity and pressure of the water at this point so let's draw a picture so it rises and then the DI diameter decreases so the height difference is 15 M feel free to pause the video and work on this example now if the height increases and if velocity was constant the pressure should decrease the increase in gravitational potential energy is provided by the decrease in the potential energy due to the decrease in pressure now because the area decreases the velocity has to increase if the velocity increases and if the height was the same the pressure would have to decrease so in this case because the gravitational potential energy is increasing and plus the kinetic energy is increasing the pressure has no choice but to decrease if the height goes up and the speed goes up the pressure has to go down there's no other way so let's calculate the new pressure so at ground level the pressure is 9 ATM that's P1 we need to find P2 but before we can find P2 we got to find V2 so the velocity V1 is 3.2 m/s so what is V2 so let's use the volume flow rate equation A1 V1 is equal to A2 V2 and a is < r s so these two cancel R1 is basically half of 8 cm if the diameter is 8 cm the radius is 4 cm V1 is 3.2 and R2 is half of 3.5 so it's 1.75 so 4^2 * 3.2 / 1.75 squar is equal to to a velocity of 16.7 m/s so the radius went down from about four to less than two if the radius decreases by factor of 2 the speed will have to increase by 2^2 or factor of four so here this the radius decreased by more than two so the speed increase by more than four so now that we have the speed let's use bui's equation to calculate the pressure so it's going to be P1 which is 9 ATM * 101300 1 atm is 10,300 pascals so 9 times that value gives you P1 which is 9,700 pascals plus PGH so let's say this is at ground level so the height is zero so there's no PGH value and then plus 12 P1 v1^2 so the density of water is 1,000 * v1^2 which is 3.22 now that's equal to P2 2+ PGH 1,00 * 9.8 * the height of 15 plus 12 pv^ 2 now 3.2 2 * 1,000 * .5 that's 5120 + 91700 on the left side the total pressure value is 91682 and then a th000 * 9.8 * 15 +0.5 * 1,000 * 16.7 2 that's uh 28644 and then plus P2 so 916 820 minus 286 445 gives you a P2 value of 630 375 pascals so as you can see because the height increase and the speed increase the pressure had to decrease it decreased from 91,000 pascals to 630,000 pascals and if you want to convert it back to ATM divide 630 375 by 101300 100 so in ATM this pressure is about 6.22 ATM so generally speaking if you want to raise a fluid to a higher position above ground level you need to decrease the pressure if the speed is going to be the same and if you want to increase the speed where the height is the same you need to decrease the pressure now if water flows to a lower level and if the speed is the same the pressure is going to increase now if water's slowing down from high speed to low speed and if the height is the same the pressure has to increase so make sure you understand when the pressure is going to go up and when it's going to go down but generally speaking if the water if the speed decreases or if the height decreases where the other thing is constant so if the speed decreases and the height is constant pressure increases if the speed is constant and the height decreases pressure increases now let's consider this problem so let's draw a house let's say this is the window of the house now if wind blows over the house what is the net upward force acting on the roof so let's say this is the side view of the roof now there's air underneath the roof and there's air above it so if there's no wind blowing the pressure above and the pressure below is the same so the pressure below exerts a force and the pressure above exerts the force so the pressure is the same these two forces cancel out and the net force is zero so remember the pressure of air at sea level is about 101.3 kPa now remember beni's principle whenever the velocity is low the pressure is high and when the velocity is high the pressure is low so if wind passes over the top surface of the roof you have high speeds so the pressure is going to be low so if you have a low pressure system or a low pressure region created by this wind basically the wind creates a vacuum it decreases the pressure above the roof and inside the house there's not much wind so the pressure inside is high therefore the upward Force exerted by the high pressure is greater by the downward force exerted by the lower pressure so there's a net upward Force that's going to lift up the roof so if the speed of the one is very very high the pressure inside the house can literally lift up the house and that's how a hurricane can pull off roofs from homes the speed of the wind above the roof if it's fast enough can decrease the pressure above the roof of the house causing the pressure inside the house to lift up the house so if that roof is not attached strongly to the house it's flying off in a hurricane now how can we quantify the net force so we need to use Bern's equation so P2 plus pgh2 + 12 p v1^2 is equal to p1+ PGH H1 + 12 P v2^2 so we're dealing with air which means the density is pretty low and the height difference of the roof is negligible so we can cancel these two terms so basically what we can do is move P1 to the left side so it's going to be P2 minus P1 1 on the left side and let's take this term move it to the right side and that's equal to 12 p v2^ 2 minus 12 PV 1^ 2 so the change in pressure is basically 12 * p and then that's v2^ 2 minus V1 2 so the change in pressure is equal to this equation and the change in pressure which is P2 minus P1 if we multiply both sides by a P2 a minus P1 a is equal to 12 P * a v2^ 2 minus V1 2 now the reason why you want to do that is because pressure is force / area so pressure times area is for so P2 a is basically FS2 and P1 a is F1 which equals what we have here so let's make some space first so therefore FS2 minus fub1 is basically the net upward Force which is 12 the density of the air times the area of the roof times the difference and the squares of the speeds so now now we can calculate the net force so it's 12 * the density of the air times the area of the roof which is 300 square m times the difference in the squares of the speeds now inside the house there's probably no wind so we could say it's zero so V1 is zero outside of the house above the roof we have a wind speed of 50 so it's going to be 50 squared so it's 0.5 * 1.29 * 300 * 50 2 so the net upward force is 4 83,7 Newtons so as you can see the force depends on the density of the air the area upon which the wind act upon and the square of the speeds so if you double the density of air the force will double if you double the area upon which the wind act upon the force will double however if you double the speed of the wind the force will quadruple because the force is proportional to the square of the speed so as the wind speed increases the force increases exponentially so to speak now if you think about it let's say if you have a ball and it's windy the wind is going to exert a force in the ball but it's not going to be that much now imagine if it's windy and if you carry let's say a very very large cardboard with a huge area so when the wind blows on the cardboard it's going to exert a large Force the larger the area the greater the force exerted by the wind and if the cardboard is large enough the wind could probably literally carry you away now here's another question for you let's say if you have a block of water something and there's a wind speed traveling this way and this way as well but the wind speed on the right side let's say it's uh 40 m/ second and the wind speed on the left side is 90 m/ second what is the direction of the net force on this uh wooden block or this piece of cardboard is the net force directed upward downward to the left or to the right what would you say now I do want to mention something in the last example the wind was moving in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the cardboard in a situation like this the wind will exert a force in a direction of motion but in this example the wind is traveling parallel to the surface of the block so according to beni's principle whenever the wind speed is low the pressure is high and whenever the wind speed is high the pressure is low so this the wind speed is parallel to it so it's going to create the high pressure when the speed is low which means that that high pressure will exert a larger Force towards the left and the low pressure will exert a small Force towards the right so therefore the net force is going to be in the direction of the side with the higher speed so in the last example the net force was an upward Force because the wind speed above the roof was larger than the speed underneath the roof and so that's why there was an upward Force now the same concept applies to the wing of an airplane so as an airplane uh moves forward the wind that travels on the upper surface has to travel a longer distance based on the design of the wing the upper surface is longer than the lower surface so the wind that travels above it has to travel at a high speed and the wind that flows beneath it has to travel at a low speed so according to beni's principle whenever the velocity of the fluid is low the pressure is high and whenever the velocity of the fluid is high the pressure is low so since we have a high pressure on underneath the wing this creates an upward lift Force So the faster the plane is moving forward the greater the upward lift force will be so let's say if you have an object and there's a speed above the object that is about 80 m/ second and the speed below it is 30 m/ second calculate the upward lift Force exerted on this block if the area of the block where the wind passes parallel to it is about let's say 400 sare met so we already have the equation we know that the net force is basically 12 the density of the air times the area times the difference in the squares of the speeds so it's 1 12 the density of air which is 1.29 time the area of 400 squ m time v2^ 2 which is uh 80 2 minus V1 2 which is 30 s so it's .5 * 1.29 * 400 that's 258 and then times 802 - 302 which the total force is 1, 419,000 Newtons"

        "transcription": "You know what can be kind of peculiar and\nsurprising? The fact that, whenever you want to shoot outside, everyone decides to mow their lawn. You know what else can be kind of peculiar\nand surprising? Water. And in the right circumstances, I could even take water that‚Äôs flowing down and spurt it straight up. How? All of these things are possible, thanks to\nthe study of the flow of fluids, known as Fluid Dynamics. [Theme Music] By now, you‚Äôve picked up on the fact that\n-- even though we live in the physical universe -- describing the rules of the universe sometimes requires us to pretend that certain things aren‚Äôt happening. Like the time we rolled a bunch of stuff down\na ramp, and pretended that there was no  kinetic friction. The same is true when we talk about fluids. Because, fluids in motion are dynamic and there are many, many things going on in and around them all at once. So, in order to grasp the essentials of fluid\ndynamics, let‚Äôs just do some pretending, shall we? For one thing, we‚Äôre going to consider the\nfluids in our examples to be incompressible, meaning that their densities won‚Äôt change. We‚Äôre also going to assume that fluids flow\nperfectly smoothly, and have no viscosity. You‚Äôve probably heard of viscosity before: When a fluid flows easily, like water, we say that it has a low viscosity. Fluids that don‚Äôt flow as easily, like honey, have a higher viscosity. And much like kinetic friction does in moving objects, viscosity tends to complicate things in moving fluids, which is why we‚Äôre generally going to pretend that the fluids we‚Äôre studying don‚Äôt have any. Now, say you have some water -- which exists\nunder all of these hypothetical conditions -- in a pipe, moving along smoothly. This pipe narrows about halfway through, so\nthat one end is narrower than the other. This shape is going to affect some of the\nproperties of the water‚Äôs flow, as it passes through the narrower side of the pipe compared to the wider side. But one thing that won't change is the mass of water that‚Äôs moving through any given area in the pipe over time. This is called the mass flow rate, and it‚Äôs\nalways going to be the same everywhere in the pipe. That‚Äôs just because, as the water flows through the pipe, it pushes along the water in the rest of the pipe, too. So if one part of the pipe has, say, a kilogram\nof water moving through it every second, the rest of the pipe ALSO has to have a kilogram\nof water moving through it every second. This fact, that the mass flow rate at one point in the pipe will be equal to the mass flow rate at any other point, is called the equation of continuity. And it can tell you a lot about the relationship between the velocity of a fluid and the cross-sectional area of the pipe that it‚Äôs flowing through. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre an engineer for the Water\nDepartment of Hypothetical City, and you need to understand the mass flow rate of hypothetical water that‚Äôs going through a certain point in your underground pipe system. But you don‚Äôt know the mass that‚Äôs going through that part of the pipe at any given moment. All you know are the water‚Äôs velocity and the area of the cross-section of that certain section of pipe. In order to describe the mass flow rate, you‚Äôll\nhave to use what we know about density, area, and velocity to work some algebra magic: First, let‚Äôs have a look at a cross section\nof that point of the pipe. From our last lesson, you know that the mass of the fluid moving past this cross-sectional area, over time, is equal to its density,\ntimes its volume. And, the volume of the fluid moving past this point is simply the area of the pipe at this cross section, times the distance the fluid\nmoves. And! From our episodes on the physics of motion,\nyou also know that the distance the fluid moves, divided by the change in time, is equal\nto the fluid‚Äôs velocity. So, by putting all that together, you can\nget a different version of the equation of continuity: At any given point in the pipe, the density\nof the fluid flowing through it, times the area of the pipe, times the fluid‚Äôs velocity, will be the same as for any other point in the pipe. And since you‚Äôre dealing with an incompressible fluid, the density is going to be the same for every point in the pipe anyway. So really, you‚Äôve just figured out that\nat any point in the pipe, the area of the pipe times the fluid‚Äôs velocity will be\nthe same as for any other point. It‚Äôs the same thing we said before: The mass\nflow rate is the same for every point in the pipe. But instead of putting that relationship\nin terms of mass and time, you‚Äôre putting it in terms of area and velocity. And, in your role as a water-department engineer,\nthis is important for you to know! Because it means that, where the pipe is narrower,\nthe fluid will have to flow faster, in order to compensate. But here‚Äôs a weird thing: A fluid that‚Äôs flowing really fast actually has less pressure than when it‚Äôs flowing more slowly. Sure, it might feel like it‚Äôs exerting more\nforce than when it flows through a wider opening. But that‚Äôs not what physicists mean when\nthey talk about the pressure in a pipe. They‚Äôre really talking about the pressure\non the walls of the pipe. This means that, the slower the fluid flows,\nthe more pressure it puts on the pipe itself. This is known as Bernoulli‚Äôs principle. It states that the higher a fluid‚Äôs velocity\nis through a pipe, the lower the pressure on the pipe‚Äôs walls,\nand vice versa. Bernoulli also came up with what we now know\nas Bernoulli‚Äôs equation. It might look kind of intimidating at first. But when you break it down, it‚Äôs actually just a way of combining a bunch of things that you‚Äôve already learned. Bernoulli based his equation on the\nconcept of conservation of energy: as a fluid flows through a pipe, it won‚Äôt gain or lose any energy. This means that, no matter where\nthe fluid is in the pipe, if you take all of the forms of energy that the fluid has at that point and add them up, they‚Äôll equal the same number\nas any other point in the pipe. To better understand this, have a look at how the three forms of energy in a fluid are represented in Bernoulli‚Äôs equation: First, there‚Äôs pressure times volume. In our episode on work and energy, we defined\nenergy as the ability to do work. And when a fluid applies pressure and moves\nthe volume of fluid that‚Äôs downstream, it‚Äôs doing work. So, pressure times volume must be a form of\nenergy. The first term in Bernoulli‚Äôs equation takes\nthat energy, and divides it by volume. Which just leaves pressure. Next, a flowing fluid also has kinetic energy. When we first talked about kinetic energy, we said that it‚Äôs equal to half of an object‚Äôs mass, times its velocity squared. Again, Bernoulli divided this form of energy by volume, to get half the fluid‚Äôs density, times its velocity squared. That‚Äôs called the kinetic energy density,\nand it‚Äôs the second term of Bernoulli‚Äôs equation. Finally, a flowing fluid also has the potential\nenergy that comes from gravity. And we‚Äôve said before that the potential\nenergy from gravity is equal to an object‚Äôs mass, times small g, times its height. When Bernoulli divided that by volume, he\ngot density times small g times height -- the potential energy density,\nand the third term of his equation. Why divide all these terms by volume? Well, when it comes to fluids, it‚Äôs just easier to talk about things in terms of density than it is to talk about mass. So when you look at his equation piece by\npiece, you can see that Bernoulli was really just putting conservation of energy into a\nspecial form that would be useful for fluids. Now, let‚Äôs look at a special case of Bernoulli‚Äôs\nequation, known as Torricelli‚Äôs theorem. Torricelli‚Äôs theorem uses conservation of energy to find the velocity of fluid flowing from a small spout in a container. And it says that the velocity of the fluid\ncoming out of the spout is the same as the velocity of a single droplet of fluid that\nfalls from the height of the surface of the fluid in the container. In other words, the pressure that‚Äôs pushing\nthe fluid out of the spout gives it the same velocity that it would get from the force of gravity. To see this theorem in action, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre not a water department engineer -- you‚Äôre just YOU, and you‚Äôre watering your garden\nwith the water you‚Äôve saved up in your rain barrel. Your barrel doesn‚Äôt have a top, and you‚Äôre\nwatering your carrots and lettuce and stuff from a hole -- or a spout -- in the side. Now: You want to know: What‚Äôs the velocity\nof the water coming out of the spout? From Bernoulli‚Äôs equation, we know that\nthe sum of the pressure, kinetic energy density, and the potential energy density of the water\nat the TOP of the cooler, will equal the sum of those three qualities of the water coming\nout of the spout. But we can simplify that relationship a bit,\nto find the velocity of the fluid coming out. First, the upper surface of\nthe water in the barrel, and the water that‚Äôs coming out of the spout, are both exposed to the atmosphere. So the pressure at those points will be the same -- it‚Äôs just the atmospheric pressure. So we can cross off the pressure from each\nside of the equation. Now, there might be water coming out of the spout, but the top of the barrel has a much bigger area. So the water at the top of the barrel isn‚Äôt\ngoing to be moving very much. In fact, we can say that its velocity is basically zero. Which means that the kinetic energy density\nfor the water at the top of the barrel is zero. Finally, we can cross out the density in each\nterm of the equation, since it‚Äôs not changing. We‚Äôre left with a much simpler equation,\nwith only three terms -- an equation that should look VERY familiar, if you‚Äôve watched our episodes on the physics of motion. It‚Äôs a kinematic equation! You already know the two main kinematic equations:\nthe definition of acceleration and the displacement curve. And you can rearrange them to get another\nequation that relates displacement, velocity, and acceleration -- without considering time. It‚Äôs exactly the same equation as the one\nwe just found by using Bernoulli‚Äôs equation to describe the velocity of the water coming\nout of the spout. So, Torricelli‚Äôs theorem tells you that if a droplet of water fell from the same height as the top of the barrel, when it reached the level of the spout, it‚Äôd have the same velocity as the water coming out of the spout. Now you know how fast the water‚Äôs\ncoming out your rain barrel, and how much water you‚Äôre putting in your garden over a certain amount of time. But you want to try something fun? Let‚Äôs turn the spout on your barrel so it‚Äôs pointing up instead of down. If the water from this spout could shoot straight up, the stream would get exactly as high as the water at the top of the barrel, before falling down to the ground. Today, you learned about fluids in motion,\nwith a focus on the continuity equation, Bernoulli‚Äôs equation, and Torricelli‚Äôs theorem. You also learned that lawn mowers are loud.

        "transcription": "And to start off, and we talk about this is\nfluid mechanics ok. The definition first of all of a fluid, the\nofficial definition in Chapter 1, let me write that down. It‚Äôs a substance that deforms continuously\nwhen acted upon by a shearing stress of any magnitude. How many people in here have had ME 218 strength\nof materials? Ok almost everybody of course. Take a piece of copper plate, copper plate\nand apply force F on it. Here‚Äôs the plate. I don‚Äôt know, an inch think, six by four\nor something like that. Apply 400 pounds on it, the top. This is fixed to the base. When you apply that force to it, you know\nfrom ME 218 for instance. There‚Äôs the plate. Now, again here‚Äôs the ground. Now I take a layer of water, I apply a force\non there. No, it doesn't look like that when I'm done\napplying force to that plate on top of water. Think what would happen if you apply a force\nto that plate on top of a water layer, I apply 10 pounds, will the plate ever stop? Of course not. If I apply 10 pounds, this room is flooded\nwith water this high, I'm walking in the water at my knees. I put a Styrofoam plate on top of it, I push\non it 2 pounds , 2 pounds with my finger, is it going to stop me from pushing ever? No, and the key word is, oh it's continuously. This will deform a little bit, then it's going\nto stop; but a fluid will deform continuously. So yeah, that's fluid, air, oil, jet fuel,\nyou name it, these things that we live with, water, they are fluids. Now there are different kinds of fluids though. We are all use to fluids like water, or coffee. Pour it from there to there, works really\nnice, works really nice. What's in this cup went in that cup. Now fill that cup there with cold air, try\nand pour cold air into that cup over there. No it won‚Äôt do it, it won‚Äôt do it, it\nwill spread out when it comes out, it will go all-apart in a big plume. Why? Because the molecules are not attached\nto each other as strongly as they are in that liquid. Are they both fluids? sure! of course they\nare. Put air in here, push on a plate in air it\nwill still move. Yeah they are both fluids, liquids and gases,\nbut not solids, not solids. Well maybe not quite, maybe not quite. Take the cap off a toothpaste, turn it upside\ndown, does it run out? Not really, no, unless its been in the car\nfor 2 hours in 100 degree temperatures. No, what makes it come out? I've got to press on the tube. Ok so it takes an initial stress, shearing\nstress to move it, to get it moving. Once it's moving it moves pretty good, but\nit takes that initial shearing stress. It could be, you know, some very thick things\nlike some epoxy‚Äôs you know, you can turn them upside down, they won't come out until\nyou squeeze the tube, a plunger. So yeah those things are kind of like fluid,\nbut we won't discuss those in this class. We are not going to worry about you know tooth\npaste epoxy and things, we will worry about water, air, oil and things like that, helium,\nfreon, you name it . So that' a big different in that, and we are\nalso going to look at two sets of units. You know a lot of textbooks now they are almost\nall in SI, which is so much easier than British system, so much easier. But unfortunately the real world doesn't go\nthat way. So our textbook, I forget the percentage,\nbut it has quite a few, I will call it English as British scribitation. Quite few problems whether they are example\nproblems or homework, in English and then a lot of SI, a lot of SI. But you graduating have to be conversant in\ntwo languages; otherwise you are not going to show off very well in the real world. You have to know two languages forward and\nbackwards really really well. The easy one is SI, the hard one is English\nengineering. For instance, how many centimeters in a meter,\nwell you can guess that one ok? How many millimeters in a meter? I‚Äôll tell\nyou, about a thousand. How many cubic centimeters in a liter? I‚Äôll\ntell you, it's 1000. Do you get the point, everything in SI. Will you go out there and close that door\nplease? Thanks. Everything, every convergent factor. Ok let me tell you another one. 1 joule divide by 1 second, what is it? Joules\nper second. Uh huh, yeah 1. Is it 1? Yeah it‚Äôs 1. Ok 1. Everything, convergent SI starts with a 1\ntimes ten to a power, you can't get any easier than that, now you tell me this, how many\npints in a quart, how many quarts in a gallon, how many gallons in a barrel? Ho ho ho, nothing starts with 1, nothing,\nmemorize that stuff? No, no, no you don‚Äôt memorize it‚Äôs right\nhere. You don‚Äôt memorize that stuff, but you still\nhave some varying instinct. Well I don't know, but I got this thing in\nmy pocket, yeah I‚Äôll tell you in a minute ok? Yeah geez, that‚Äôs ok but I mean if you divide\nby gallons in a barrel no even amount will come out. No, it‚Äôs awful; it‚Äôs awful, oh power. How many foot pounds per second is a horsepower? Well you know, how about, how many watts in\na kilowatt? Well I‚Äôll tell you, how about a thousand? 1 times 10 to the 3rd. So oh yeah, I mean don‚Äôt you wish the whole\nworld was SI? Of course we all do. But it's not, and you live in a country that's,\nyou live in the worst country for it, a country that is still has both unit systems, so you\nhave to be really really really good at both of them. That's why, that‚Äôs why my point is, that's\nwhy when we select a textbook, we make sure the textbook has, if we can find it, duel\nunit systems in it, because we know the more you practice the better you get. The problems is most work problems in SI where\nthey need to practice in English engineering. Ok well that‚Äôs neither here nor there, we\nthere's problems here there will be problems on homework of both, there will be problems\non tests of both. You can use your, you can use your smart phone\nfor conversions, there‚Äôs conversions on the inside back cover too, SI to British gravitational. So your choice but there will be both kinds\nof problems ,for homework and exams. Ok lets just briefly go over the two unit\nsystems. Let's do SI first. Ok, force is in Newton‚Äôs. Our mass is in kilograms. And of course length is in meters. Ok lets do British Gravitational. Force is in pounds. Mass is in slugs. Length is in feet, and they both have seconds\nfor time. There is a third unit system that has force\nin pounds force, mass in pounds mass, but this is the British Gravitational. You don't put a subscript on this guy, because\nyou know if it's in this system, and it says pounds it has got to be force. So you can skip putting the subscript F on\npounds. Unfortunately you don't deal with pounds under\nmass, you deal with slugs. These are not little creepy crawly slimy things\non to the floor, these are not snails they are slugs. A slug is a unit of mass, how big is it? Anybody\nknow how many pounds mass are in a slug? What‚Äôs the gravitation acceleration in inches,\n32.2 right? There you go, 32.2 pounds mass in 1 slug. That means the slug is more massive than a\npound mass, a slug is more massive. Ok so, those are the two unit systems, when\nyou work on problems for homework or exams that‚Äôs what you use there. Ok now, lets take a look, if you've had physics\nor thermo‚Ä¶ Rho density, density mass per volume. If it's in SI, kilograms per cubic meter. If it's in British gravitational, mass slugs\nper cubic foot. Specific weight, gamma, weight per volume. SI, weight, weight is a force. Newtons per cubic meter. British Gravitational, force, pounds per cubic\nfoot. Specific gravity. Ok, gamma of the fluid in question under gamma\nof water at a certain temperature, like I think it's 4 degrees, yeah 4 degrees C. R is 39 degrees F, so it's a ratio, a ratio\nis dimensionless. So it's a dimensionless number, specific gravity. Gamma is the specific weight of the fluid\nyou are studying, divided by gamma of water at a certain temperature. Ideal gas, our perfect gas law. P over rho equal R times T. P and Tare absolute values. Absolute pressure, absolute temperature, we\nwill mention absolute pressure in just a little bit. You know absolute temperature at 273 degrees\nC, degrees K. Add 460 degrees F to get degrees R, it's in\nthe book. This is for gasses, so the good news is what\nwe are studying in this class, pretty much all the gasses behave like that. As long as you are around ambient conditions\nof air, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen behave like that. Viscosity, viscosity is mu, sometimes called\nabsolute viscosity. Ok now, lets get to our definition of mu. Mu this is  the big property that‚Äôs different in a thermal\nclass. What page is that on? Well look after if that‚Äôs ok, if I find\nit. This is shearing stress, tau is \nshearing stress from ME 218. Du dy, this is called a velocity gradient. So if we take a simple case again, take that\nplate on water, and here is water. Maybe the velocity looks like this, this will\nbe capital V velocity, and then this is typical of how the velocity might look between the\nplate. Let's make it linear, make life easy right\nnow, we don‚Äôt want to get too exotic day 1. So this is called a linear velocity gradient\nbecause it is a straight line. Velocity versus the height, the height is\ny, the velocity is lower case u. U is a function of y, differentiate that,\nthat‚Äôs called a velocity gradient. You take the velocity gradient like in a bearing. Bearing, or surface that is rotating on its\nstationary, stationary, moving. You got 10 weight oil, that's mu, multiply,\nwhere do you get mu of oil? Back of the book in the appendix . What's the temperature? I don‚Äôt know, 120 degrees fahrenheit. Go back to the book, find mu, put it in here,\nmultiply it by du dy, which is v divided by the separation distance. And that's going to give you the shearing\nstress that the fluid creates. So viscosity is a property, which is useful\nto determine shearing stresses. And there is another property, which is nu,\nwhich is mu over rho; this is called kinematic viscosity. So there are two possible viscosities. One is the real thing, the real thing is this\none up here, this is really the viscosity. If someone just says viscosity to you then\nyou assume they mean this one. That's why it is also called absolute and\nkinematic. Just to be certain that someone knows what\nyou are giving them. If you say the viscosity though, the default\ndefinition is here. Kinematic viscosity is this value divided\nby the density rho. This thing comes in handy we will see later\non in some equations. It appears the ration mu divide by rho, appears\nin some equations so it's given a special name called the kinematic viscosity. Ok, the units, aw the unit system. If you don‚Äôt memorize those things, I hate\nto. If you don‚Äôt memorize them, then figure\nout what they are, what is this guy? Force divided by area, ok so, force divided\nby area. The area of this is length squared. What's this guy? Velocity, length over time. What's this guy? Length. Ok, cancel, cancel. So figured out the mu is F, this guy is in\nthe denominator, this guy is in the denominator, put him up here, FT over L squared. This nu kinematic viscosity, divide that guy\nby mass divided by length cubed, density. Mass divided by length cubed. We go back here. Viscosity, English units, what are they? Pounds\nsecond per foot squared. Look at it. Pound over there, pound second per foot squared,\nyeah. I don‚Äôt memorize that stuff, I derive one\nif I have to, if I have to. So there is no reason to memorize it because\nyou know you can derive it, where does it come from? The basic governing equation right\nthere. Ok, now let's go on to our last two properties. Next one, by the way before we forget, lets\njust go ahead and put this graph up here. This is shearing stress Tau right there, this\nis du dy velocity gradient, sometimes called the rate of shearing strain, but the velocity\ngradient is sufficient. This is air, this is water, and this is oil. Oh yeah we know intuitively oil is viscous. It will give you very high shear stress for\ncertain value of du dy, given the value of du dy, air is not very viscous, water is in\nthe middle of the road, oils are very viscous. Notice those are linear too, which is very\nimportant, those are linear. Those fluids are called Newtonian. There many which are not linear, which we\nwon‚Äôt will study in ME 311, Examples, tooth paste, no its not Newtonian. Latex paint, no it's not. When you put that paint on a brush, put that\nbrush in water, pull it out of there, oh the water just runs off. You would be running for the wall, to get\nup to the wall before it ran off your paint brush. Now you put that in there, in latex paint,\ntake it out there, and turn the brush, it stays 124 00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:32,259 on the brush fibers until you get to the wall, then you just roll it on or paint it on. Yeah it's different, it's not linear, it's\nnot linear, the graphs are in the book that way. quick sad, not linear, no no. The more you try and get out, the harder it\nis for you. You got to go really really slowly, dont try\nand pull your foot out, you go in deeper. It's all in this graph, tells the whole story. I‚Äôll just show you a couple, some go like\nthis, some go like that, here is quick sand, here is latex paint, there is tooth paste,\nyou know, maybe stuff like that. That's just for your own sideline right now,\nwhat your worried about, are the 3 things us ME's and CE's look at most in life. Aero's & ME's, Aero‚Äôs & CE‚Äôs, umm mostly\nME's, engines and things like that you know. So we are not going to worry about those other\nexotic ones, we are going to worry about things like these 3 right here. They are all going to be Newtonian Fluids\nin ME311. Ok let's go to 1 more, ok lets see here we\ngo; surface tension. Surface tension, the symbol for that is sigma,\nthere‚Äôs sigma, and sigma is the force per unit length, so sigma has dimensions of force\nper length. Here is a reservoir; I put this tube in there,\ninverted. The liquid will rise up in that reservoir\nsomething like this, you might have seen a mercury barometer on the wall, and the mercury\nrises up that glass tube and you read off what the mercury level is. The guy night on the news says, ‚ÄúOk the\nweather forecast, cold front is coming on from Canada, and the barometer is dropping,\nits right now 30.05 inches of mercury.‚Äù We say, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean there is mercury\ndropping out of the sky on people's heads?‚Äù No, no, now ask any of your friends at night,\nsay to them, ‚ÄúWhat does he mean when he says the pressure is 30 inches of mercury?‚Äù Most folks don't have the slightest of course,\nthey don't, ask them their tire pressure, oh they will tell you 30-32 pounds in my tires. Do they really mean 32 pounds of air is in\nyour tire? No, no , they taking shortcuts, they mean\nto say 32 psi in my tire. Well, if you put mercury in here, fill the\ntube with mercury, invert it, thumb off there, the mercury rises up. At this point right here, mercury does this. Around the glass perimeter, where the glass\nand mercury are in contact, the mercury is being pulled down, that's surface tension,\nthat‚Äôs surface tension. Take water, here is a tube of water. Do the same thing, it doesn't work quite as\nwell. But it looks like that, the water is being\npulled up by the glass it seems like, so it's a property, it's a property of fluid and temperature. So that's why it‚Äôs force per unit length,\nwhat length is this length? It's the perimeter of the glass tube, the\nperimeter pi times d. So that's a phenomenon that occurs quite often\nin fluids that you should be aware of. What's this thing called? Surface tension. Try and put, you can do it if you do it really\ncarefully, a dime, a dime on water if you are really really really careful, you can\nfloat it on water, it won't sink, it won't sink. Something is holding, pulling it up around\nthe perimeter, something is pulling it up, and that's the water doing that, and that's\nthe surface tension in the water. So those are all part of the concept of surface\ntension. Ok I think that pretty much covers all of\nour important properties in there, so let's take a look then at pressure. All right, now let's go back over here to\nthis thing on here, let's talk about pressure. Its one of the big concepts in our first fluids\ncourse What do you call pressure in ME218 strengths?\nPressure? Stress, what's stress? Force per unit area,\nwhat's pressure? Force per unit area. Right right, different but just different,\nthose guys are solids, these guys are liquids. Ok, let's start off by absolute pressure. We will put them all down, Gage pressure. Ok, absolute, referenced to 0 pressure. Referenced to local atmospheric pressure. We‚Äôll use our standard pressure, 14.7 psi. And I think for our, well just use 101 kpa. It‚Äôs like 101.3 something something something,\n101 kpa. So these are the standard pressure values,\nwe are not going to use the value in Pomona which is I don‚Äôt know 800 feet above sea\nlevel. These guys are at sea level, and I don‚Äôt\nknow 34 degrees data too I don‚Äôt know, something like that. They are standard values, we will use those. Ok gage pressure, reference to local atmospheric\npressure. The world local means where you are when you\nmake the measurement, local means where you are when you make the measurement. If you are in Pomona at Cal Poly Pomona, it's\nthe pressure here, that‚Äôs' the local atmospheric pressure. If you are in Denver Colorado, it's the pressure\nin Denver Colorado, at that time of the day, that day of the year, so that's reference\nto where you are. Ok now let's talk about these guys, gage pressure\ncan be positive or negative. These guys are always positive because their\nreferences to zero, unless there is a negative absolute pressure. Negative gage pressures are sometimes called\nvacuum pressures. So hear the word vacuum pressure, and some\ngages will show you positive pressures and vacuum pressures, that's what they mean by\nthat. So let's draw a little picture here to show\nus these pressures. The pressures, I will put a little board with\nthe values of some conversion factors too for you. Let's start off with zero pressure down here. Zero absolute, and let's say that this is\nthe local atmospheric pressure. And let's call that 101 kpa. And lets call the pressure up here PA. If I measure PA from the local atmospheric\npressure, reference to local atmosphere pressure, that's this line right here. And PA is going to be, this is given, 200\nkpa, gage. This is 101 kpa, absolute. This pressure is 101 plus 200, its not to\nscale, 301. If the pressure is down here, and let's say\nthat it's minus 50 kpa gage vacuum. Then the absolute pressure, always measured\nfrom the bottom down up to here, 101 minus 50, 51. 52 kpa and that's absolute. In the textbook I think he gives us a big\nhint, lets see what pressures are her, this picture is in the book too by the way, yeah\nso on page 50. Ok here‚Äôs what he says in italics. In this textbook, pressures will be assumed\nto be gage pressures unless there is specifically designated as absolute. In this book, or homework, in an exam, or\na problem, the pressures are assumed to be gage unless it specifically says absolute. So If I give you a problem on an exam, and\nit says the pressure is 50 kpa, that means you assume that‚Äôs gage. Unless I put that, then it‚Äôs absolute, so\nthat's default rule. The default rule is, pressures that just are\nin kpa, assume that they are gage, unless they are absolute, there will be a parentheses\nwith abs after. Or the problem will say the absolute pressure\nis 50 kpa. Ok, in English engineering or British Gravitational,\nif someone tells you pressure of the air in your tire, make it easy, is 30 psi, how did\nthey measure? Oh probably a tire pressure gauge I would\nsuspect, tire pressure gauge. How does a tire pressure gauge work? Oh a typical example, there is a spring in\nthis thing and the stem pops up and you read it, or there‚Äôs a circular gauge you put\non your tire and read it. Take the spring loaded one, what's the pressure\nin your tire doing to that thing? Oh it's compressing the spring as it pushes it up. What's it working against? What‚Äôs outside\nthat pencil like device? Atmospheric pressure. So what's it measuring the pressure with respect\nto? Uh huh, 30 psi means that 30 psi gage, and\nwe don't say 30 psi gage, we say my tire pressure is 30 psig, that‚Äôs standard practice, psig\nmeans gage. If somebody says well then what's the absolute\npressure of the air in my tires, there it goes, there it is. You‚Äôre up here now at 30, 30 above local\natmosphere, 30, local atmosphere, I think I erased it, yup there it is, 14.7. 30 plus 14.7, 44.7 psia, means absolute, that's\njust the way that most engineers work, they use psig for gage pressure, psia for absolute\npressure. But in the world of SI, in the world of SI\nyou don‚Äôt say, you don‚Äôt say this, there is no such unit kpag, it‚Äôs no, there is\nno kpag in the world. So what you do? You have a rule; textbook\nrule says if I don't put anything after kpa, you assume that it's a gage. If it‚Äôs absolute, I‚Äôll put abs after it. Just so on a exam you don‚Äôt say professor\nBiddle what do you mean by that kpa, I‚Äôll say go back to default what did it say? You only get confused on an exam at the time\nof the exam, it makes life miserable. Ok so, that's the pressure now, and the guy\nthat says what do you want your tires at 35 pounds? Say no I want 35 psi, because they take a\nshort cut, they just say pounds, they really mean psi of course, but they say pounds. Ok now let's take a look at some problems,\nsimilar to homework. Lets see which one I looked at here; I will\ntake this one first because this is a new one. 177, 177 you have 178 and 180 they are all\nthe same kind of problem, they‚Äôre viscosity problems, viscosity problems. So we don‚Äôt need this. Ok I will read it for you, it‚Äôs a snow sled. The sled shown in the picture slides along\na thin horizontal layer of water, between the ice and the runners. So here‚Äôs the sled, problem 177, here‚Äôs\nice, I‚Äôm going to expand it up, here‚Äôs water, here ‚Äòs the runner on the sled, a\nblade, that‚Äôs a skate blade. The horizontal force that the water puts on\nthe runners is equal to 1.2 pounds. Here‚Äôs the, ok ill put this for you guys. The sleds‚Äô speed is 50 feet per second. The sled, the runner, the blade runs on water\nnot ice, water, the total area of both the runners in contacts with the water is 0.08\nsquare feet. The viscosity of water if they didn't give\nit to you, it's in the back of the book, but they gave it to you, viscosity of water 3.5. So this is mu, they didn‚Äôt say kinematic\nthey just said viscosity assume its absolute. 3.5 times 10 to the minus 5 pound seconds\nper foot squared. Determine the thickness of the water layer\nunder the runners. D, find d. Keep reading; assume a linear velocity distribution\nin the water layer, assume a linear velocity distribution in the water layer. So draw this. V is the velocity at the top of the water\nlayer, it goes down to 0 at the ice, the velocity at a solid surface is assumed to be at rest\nfor the water, it's called the no slip condition. Right here, this is called no slip. It means the water doesn't slip along the\nice, the velocity of the water at the surface of the ice is assumed to be zero. We will make that assumption pretty much throughout\nthis whole course, the no slip condition. Ok, so I erased it, yeah I erased our equation,\nso we have our tau equal mu du/dy,. Our shear stress we know is force over area,\nmu du/dy, we are measuring y from here up like this. Ok  force is 50 pounds force, 50 pounds, aww 1.2lbs,\nvelocity is 50. Ok 1.2 divided by \narea 0.08, equal mu, ok there is mu, right there 3.5 times 10 to the minus five, pound\nsecond per foot squared. Multiply by du/dy, don‚Äôt forget it's a linear\nprofile, so you know lucky you, du/dy if it's linear, equal delta u over delta y. Delta u at the top, v at the bottom, zero. Delta y at the top, d, at the bottom, zero. there it is, du/dy, is delta u over delta\ny, equal v over D. V, 50, d is going to be in feet, check it\nout, it better come out right here. Ok seconds divide by seconds. Feet, feet squared, feet squared here, feet,\nfeet gone, the right hand side, pounds per foot squared, left hand side, pounds per foot\nsquared, we are good to go. Solve for d, it will be in feet, 11.7 10 to\nthe minus 4. 1 ten thousandths of an inch, 1 ten thousandths\nof an inch, that's the amount of liquid water between the blade surface and the ice on the\nKings hockey people. Not a lot, it doesn't take a lot, it doesn‚Äôt\ntake a lot, but there is a layer of water under there. I want to show you how you set up the homework\nproblems, and I will go over it again when you pass your first homework set in, but do\nthat , the first thing you do, is you draw a sketch is it is appropriate. I mean were engineers, we love sketches. If you are a mathematician, you love equations\nand you hate sketches; you want the theoretical solution. If you are an engineer you love pictures,\nand you will do the math because you have to do the math, you don't love the math maybe\nbut you will do it, because you have to do, it‚Äôs in your toolbox. So most engineers think more clearly if they\nhave a picture, on exam I guarantee, that if you try and sketch something on exam, whether\nit is a free body diagram which is essential, ME 214. What it does to you, is it builds a time delay\nin your brain, you don't start writing down and putting numbers or something. And you read the problem, when you sketch\nit your mind is working in the background, believe it or not, and it makes life a lot\neasier if you do it that way, I guarantee it. Because the way you get flustered & frustrated\nis trying start putting numbers on that handheld calculator right away, oh that just destroys\nyou. If your unsure of yourself that puts you down,\nway down there, what you do is you build about 60 second time delay in there so your mind\nstarts to think about that problem, and the best way to do it, is to draw a picture. When you draw that picture, your mind starts\nto think, it's amazing, the engineering thought process. So anyway, if it's appropriate, it‚Äôs not\nall the time, but if it‚Äôs appropriate draw a sketch. Once you draw the sketch, I don't care the\nproblem has it listed there in paragraph 1, if you put these guys down and look at the\npicture you start to see things. When you write the equation down you start\nto things, what do I know, what don't I know, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it,\nI don't know it, your mind starts to think like that. So much of engineering is having an approach\nto solve a problem. We are not backyard you know in your garage\nmaking something, you know that‚Äôs you know, where not doing that in your garage, we engineers\nare trained to think correctly, it's pretty fascinating, pretty fascinating. Ok next thing you do, put the equation down,\nin symbolic terms. I don‚Äôt want to see any numbers in there,\nuntil you write the equation down so I know you are using the right equation, write the\nequation. Then you put the numbers in them, then you\nput the units by each number, I am repeating things I know I‚Äôve been beating your heads\nfor 3,4, or 5 years, but I am going to do it one more time. Put the units in, cancel them out like this,\nand end up with what you want. All those steps are important steps, as you\ndo them in the right order, you will be amazed of how things kind of fall out. There might be three or four possible equations,\nyou might write down three equations. You look at the equations, you look at this\nover here, and you say uh no that‚Äôs not going to work, one equation two unknowns. Uh no that‚Äôs not going to work, one equation\nthree unknowns, um yeah, he is going to work. So you don‚Äôt always know, you don‚Äôt always\nknow which equation might work at the start, sometimes you do, sometimes you don't. But if you don't, write down the equations\nyou think might work, and stare at it, stare at them a while, maybe something will jump\nout at you, hopefully, hopefully. Whether it is homework or an exam, now let\nme tell you something else, you don‚Äôt get ready for an exam by copying the solution\nmanual. No, no, no, I mean you, tell Kershaw did you\nread how to throw the curve ball before the game? He said, are you kidding me? No, I don‚Äôt\ndo stuff like that. I throw it myself 50 times on the sidelines. I developed a new pitch, a slider. How? No, no, I practiced it; I throw a thousands\ntimes on the sideline. You don‚Äôt get good until you suffer through\nsome homework, and say gosh I just don't get this. I went through that, I get so mad sometimes,\nI take my fist and I go, I don't know why I'm not getting this, at home, in my bedroom\nwith some nice music on and a Pepsi in my hand. But I still got mad; I got so frustrated and\nflustered, but I worked my way through it, and boy you are better for it, you are better\nfor the pain. The way you prepare for your exams is you\nare not surprised. And how are you not surprised? You look at\nall the problems I worked in class, you read the example problems in the textbook, and\nyou go over homework. Don't read their solutions, because you won't\nbe ready for the exam then. Oh sure you've seen the solutions, but on\nan exam, you won't be ready, you have got to practice it yourself, and put yourself\nin a tough spot, in a real tough spot. Ok we have finished chapter 1, here are your\nassignments the next 2 class meetings, oh and by the way my office hours I can make\nother times Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday I‚Äôm here all 3 days. If those office hours don‚Äôt match with yours\nlet me know, we can meet some other time of day that‚Äôs fine, all right we will see you\nthen on Wednesday."

        "transcription": "This fluid simulator is what we are going to build to this series. And once it is ready to go, we study all kinds of fluid dynamical phenomena. Familiar things like lift and drag, but also more unfamiliar things like vortex shedding or pressure-velocity interplay. And there is a very good reason, why we don‚Äôt just pick any of the ready-made software tools. Partly, it comes in handy; we dive into the fundamentals anyway, so why not directly applying what we learn. But more importantly, building it on our own makes us also believe in it. Not just learning concepts and equations but really seeing where they come from and how they come into play, that‚Äôs what makes the difference. And we won‚Äôt miss out on that opportunity. And to get all this going, we start at the subatomic level that underlies molecular interactions. We use then different approaches to reduce the problems complexity. In particular, we average out the molecules by establishing the fluid as a continuous field. This continuum is then discretized spatially and temporally, whatever that will mean. And we wrap it all up with a proper boundary treatment. Once we really understand the simulator, we can rely on it for answering any upcoming question. And a super nice benefit of having our own simulator is that we have full control over it. Meaning, we can actively manipulate the physics and see how phenomena are inherently linked to it. But first things first. To get the mathematical foundation right, we have to dive into fields like computational fluid dynamics ‚Äì or CFD for short. And CFD is one of those topics. It likes to come with the notion of being unsettling. But whenever you feel overwhelmed, it is a good idea to step back and appreciate that all can be broken down into a few core ideas. And we will uncover all of them in this series. In this first part we focus on the microscopic foundation that really justifies all of the macroscopic implementations of fluid simulation. So, my primary goal here is that by the end of this video, you will have a clear understanding of the microscopic perspective of fluid dynamics ... ... and by the end of the series you will have a good sense of fluid simulation in general. Alright, let‚Äôs dive in. I bet all of you have a certain idea of how fluids work. Maybe you think of it in terms of discrete colliding particles ... ... or in terms of a continuous flowing medium. To get on the same page, we start off by aligning our perspectives of fluids. They are all useful, but some are more useful depending on the context. Here is what I mean. The central theme underlying simulating fluids is reducing information in every possible way. The reason is simply, we can‚Äôt just process all the raw information that is out there. So, before we even start simulating anything, let‚Äôs get a rough idea of the multitude of information we are dealing with. If we are going to represent all the molecules that make up the fluid on a computer, two things show up immediately: (a) there are simply too many of them, and not just a bit too much, but overwhelmingly too much, and (b) there is information we would like to know but rather statistically or maybe not at all. Take the rotation of a molecule. Think about it. Do you expect a significant offset, say in lift, if this particular molecule is rotated differently? This right here. Or take the location of the molecules. What matters in the end, are the average states of larger portions of them. And given all that, modelling subatomic mechanisms on a quantum level for each molecule would be of the charts ... ... at least when we are interested in quantities of a more global character like the net-lift-force for instance. Ok, I think we can all agree on that we have to get rid of a lot of this information. But how exactly? How do we emphasis mathematically what‚Äôs relevant for us, and averages out the rest we don‚Äôt care about? Well, there is not ‚Äúthe‚Äù correct way. The approach we will take consists of several layers or modules. But these can be swapped by alternatives as needed. And this right here is important, building a simulation in a modular way, means giving structure. We will use a lot of these tools in future series, and a structured perspective will pay off. Ok, to really build it from ground up; let‚Äôs get clear about a good starting point ‚Äì the quantum mechanics. And to understand why we need each layer of abstraction, we have to understand what‚Äôs problematic about everything underneath. So, what is the problem that quantum mechanics tries to approach? As we will see, this problem is so severe, that simulating even small fluid systems on a quantum level is practically impossible. Ok, to see what is going on, we have to look at fundamental properties of nature. It ultimately boils down to how we think about measuring. For a macroscopic object, like this ball for instance, tracking its path or trajectory is an easy task. You just look at it or use any other device that looks for you. The problem is how do you track the path of smaller things, like an elementary particle? This could be an electron that moves around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom for instance? You have to rethink what looking means. Let‚Äôs build an experiment. Here we use a laser to shoot photons towards the atom which itself is placed in an electric field. A photon may then kick the electron out of the electrostatic potential well, |that surrounds the atom. And when that happens, the electron is accelerated by the electric field to the right side, where its localized influence is detected. Now, the details are not important here, but if this experiment is performed in the right way ... ... it is possible to gain information about the original location of electrons within an atom. This is awesome, seeing where electrons where in an atom ... ... although by doing so, we change the electrons future significantly. In this sense, looking really means interacting. The specimen and the measuring device - electron and photon - are simply closer on the energy scale compared to any macroscopic composition. So, while you measure, you exert influence. Even if we use an experiment that does not rip the atom apart, we have to feel the electron in one way or another. So, practically, tracking an undisturbed trajectory of such small things appears impossible. Unfortunately, there is an even more fundamental limit about how certain you can ever be in terms of location and momentum, of a particle ... ... regardless of the measurement process ‚Äì the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. So even theoretically, talking about trajectories of such small things loses meaning. What does not lose meaning, however, is averaging many observations to yield a different kind of information ... ... a probabilistic perspective. Because what makes sense nonetheless is to think about how likely it would be to detect an electron in a certain region of the atom. And depending on properties such as the electron energy, or strength of the electric field ... ... these probability distributions come in many different shapes. If there are multiple electrons around an atom, the picture is even more complicated since electron motion is correlated. So, a true multi-electron probability distribution is not simply a composition of the single-electron shapes ... ... although it can be approximated by using them as a starting point. Either way, the result is always a probability distribution. The next peculiar thing about these small elementary particles is ... ... they behave not only particle-like, which means there is an integer number of them, and once measured you observe their impact at a certain distinct location ... ... but they also behave wave-like, meaning they go around corners and superimpose - diffract and interfere - as long as you do not observe them. In this series, I don‚Äôt want to focus on why nature has chosen behaves this way ... ... ut what it means for us, as we want to derive models upon this basis. After all, we want to study fluid dynamics. But first we have to get there. So, to make sense of these probabilities and wave-like properties, some people decided to develop a mathematical tool ... ... that reflects this indeterminate nature, they see in all their experiments, in its core. And this tool is called quantum mechanics. The core of the approach relies on two mathematical objects ... ... a wave function that contains information about the states of all considered particles ... ... and an evolution equation ‚Äì the Schr√∂dinger equation that works on the wave function and tells us how it changes with time. From the new wave function you can then derive the probabilities again. And this is the same kind of probability we talked about before. It tells us how likely it is do detect a particle in a certain region of space. We have a model for what we see in our measurements. The exact form of the evolution equation is here irrelevant; it is the underlying concept that is problematic. What we are really concerned about is, how computationally expensive it would be to perform such calculations for a given volume of our fluid. And in that regard, we only need to know that it takes a certain amount of time to perform the evolution operation. So, let‚Äôs build some simulations. For our single particle here, the wave function assigns a complex number to each point in this two-dimensional space. The evolution equation now takes all these numbers and a problem dependent term that specifies the rules of evolution ‚Äì the Hamiltonian ... ... and advances these numbers continuously and deterministically along time. So, the same initial wave function will always give the same evolution. We can now represent the infinite number of these points and time steps by a finite number of values, that a computer can handle. We will talk about such spatial and temporal discretizations later in more detail. For now, let‚Äôs just assume, we restrict our view to a sub region of space ... ... and subdivide this field to have a thousand sections along each side. This means, each of these cells stores a single complex number ... ... and Erwin here has to figure out, how a million complex numbers change ... ... since each of these numbers represents a part of the particles wave function. It can be everywhere, and we need to account for that. A million ‚Ä¶ just for one particle to move through a tiny portion of space. You may think, the problem is now simply that we need too many of these cells to fill up the fluid volume. But it gets even worse, by orders of magnitude. Look at this. If we look at only one slice of our 2D plane, we cannot explain ... ... why the wave suddenly behaves differently compared to a particle that lives in 1D. We don‚Äôt see the walls in this slice. This influence has to be provided by neighboring slices. Likewise, if we look at only one cell, we have absolutely no idea why it does what it does. Everything is coupled through the evolution of one underlying wave function ... ... and neighboring cells have to tell us what is going on over there. This dependence on one wave function is even more striking when we think about multiple particles. These two particles live in one dimension, they move towards each other, and in general, their motion depends on each other. And you can now quantify how likely it is that particle one is detected in this arbitrarily selected region ... ... WHILE particle two is detected in that region. This gives a joint probability. Since each particle‚Äôs individual probability distributions cover all of 1D space ... ... we need more degrees-of-freedom, more space to store the joint information. So, there is still only one wave function that gives rise to the probabilities ... ... but it lives in two dimensions! Both particles are then represented by the joint probability of detecting one particle at a certain location ... ... WHILE the other particle is detected somewhere else. You can still describe the probability of a particle alone ... ... by extending the range of detection along the other particle axis to +-infinity. Again, the wave function describes a joint probability and tells you something about a combined measurement outcome. And by considering every possible position of the other particle, you get the individual particle probabilities. In this sense, both particles‚Äô probabilities eventually appear as so called marginal probabilities ... ... by looking along different directions, each giving a unique perspective on the same high dimensional wave function. So far, we have a pure mathematical framework ... ... that we should now equip with different properties to reflect known physical behavior. For instance, some particles repel each other ... ... and by using inter particle potentials we can force the wave function to account for that. We will learn more about potentials later in this part. A particularly important property is, that particles of the same kind are indistinguishable ... ... they can‚Äôt be physically labeled. So, you don‚Äôt detect electron one and electron two. You detect one of the electrons and the other one. By implementing symmetries, you see that both electrons can be detected in switched positions ... ... making this model useful for physics. So, after all, while the physical 1D space may be discretized using just 1000 cells. The 2D wave function for both particles requires, in the worst case without symmetries, one million cells. If we have two particles in a 2D physical space ... ... the wave function lives in a 4D space. As much as this may be confusing at first, it is also a challenging task for Erwin here. He has now to work on a million times a million cells. For two particles! So far, it seems we are simply lost in computational complexity. Ok, there will be shortcuts and approximations. But then again, through five more particles in ... ... each bringing its own set of additional dimensions along. Oh, and we do live in three dimensions ... ... and some particles have additional properties such as spin ... ... so the probability space is even larger! You see where I am going with this. It gets impossible really quickly, at least when using conventional computers. Ok, this is the result we expected, since we knew from the beginning ... ... that it will be impossible to simulate a fluid quantum mechanically. But I‚Äôm always curious about where everything comes from ... ... and really seeing why something is a bad idea is not a bad idea. So, we need to do better. We need to construct a surrogate model, that represents the essential physical properties, ... ... while being way faster to solve. And whenever you want to simplify, you can usually select among a variety of approaches. One popular way to reduce information builds on the fact that dynamical systems often evolve in specific patterns. To demonstrate this, we look at this one-dimensional particle here represented by its wave function components. To keep it around the center of the scene, we add a so-called potential ... ... that pushes it back, the further it goes off-center. It is nothing special; it works a bit like a marble in a bowl ... kind off. We discuss potentials in a minute when we focus on modeling inter-atomic behavior. Anyway, this is the kind of instruction we must tell the evolution equation via the Hamiltonian ... ... which basically keeps track of the total energy of the system, and potential energy is certainly part of it. So, as we start the simulation ... Erwin, please... We see the wave function and so the probability wiggles around and a certain repetitiveness appears. And here is the clue, it is possible to construct a few specific wave function shapes or standing waves ... ... that combined in the right way approximate the true evolution astonishingly accurate. So instead of evolving 1000 individual cells, we only evolve a few individual scaling factors ... ... of these superimposed shapes, also called mode shapes. And, in our case, due to the linear form of the evolution equation, ... ... these scaling factors are even simpler to compute. So, once you have these shapes, you save a lot of computational time here. The name ‚Äústanding wave‚Äù simply reflects that the probability which determines the measurement outcome  does not change, ... ... although the underlying wave function components do oscillate with a certain frequency. This is possible, if each individual complex number happens to evolve along a circle in the complex plane. In this way, the probability as the absolute squared of the wave function value stays constant. And the oscillation frequency of this rotation will be super important later on. What‚Äôs good is, the choice of shapes and their number, ... ... gives you the freedom to adjust the accuracy for the reduced model to your needs. And this approach is not limited to quantum mechanics. It is a general mathematical tool, sometimes called model order reduction ... ... but it is known by many names, and it is a huge topic on its own ... ... and we will explore and apply it many times in the future. But right now, it is not what we need. It does provide the features for a drastic reduction and is often applied with great success, ... that‚Äôs why I had to mention it here, but it does not change what you are modelling. Here it means, you are still concerned with wave functions and probabilities ... ... and representing a gazillion fluid cells by a trillion modes does not really help for our goal. In fact, computing these shapes for higher dimensional systems in the first place is complicated on its own. Right now, we need a different kind of reduction. We need a change of the underlying paradigm. We NEED molecular dynamics. You see, so far, we evolved all values of the wave function in a possibly large space, ... ... simply because the nature of joint probabilities left us no other choice. But what if we could ignore the wave-like properties and probabilities? What if particles could be distinctly located and we could nail down on single trajectories? Instead of iterating over all of space, we would simply evolve some unique location and velocity vectors. Ok, for these two particles here we see, the vector of positions and velocities combined lives actually in a larger space, ... ... called phase space, compared to the space of the wave function, which is written only in positions or momenta (and spin etc. ;-) ). But it is only one point in this phase space that we need to evolve, ... ... no matter how high dimensional the phase space will be. And that is the benefit of having localized particles. You just don‚Äôt need to keep track of other possible scenarios (meaning possible states). But we learned that electrons and other sub-atomic particles do evolve in vastly different scenarios ... ... and prior to any measurement we can only know so much about their location. So, at what mass or length scale, is it okay to assume having almost localized behavior, although it will never be truly correct? Well, it turns out, around the size of atoms. And this here is where molecular dynamics comes into play. It is a computational method that models all atoms as particles in a classical mechanics framework. So, all sub-atomic particles of an atom are composed into a single mass that moves on a unique trajectory. Likewise, all interactions in terms of attraction, repelling, and bonding between these atoms ... ... are represented by forces, that depend on the distance. And these forces are implied by so-called inter-atomic potentials, ... ... which describe how much work is needed to move a particle from one place to another. But as work is just the integration of a force over a path, its derivative is just the force. This here, is the Lennard-Jones potential, and it is a popular choice ... ... for inter-atomic modeling of weak Van der Walls attraction while also having strong repulsion. That‚Äôs just typical atomic behavior in action. And as we had an evolution equation for the wave function in quantum mechanics, ... ... we have an evolution equation for positions and velocities in classical mechanics, Newtons second law of motion. In essence it states, the net force acting on a mass determines its rate of change of momentum. By numerical integration, you get the updated velocities and positions, you simulate. Now, looking at this setup, it appears quite simple. Just some atom-particles moving in potentials instead of wave functions ... And it is truly a big step forward! But how do we justify it? How is the inter-atomic potential computed? Why can we see particles as being localized? Let‚Äôs break it down into simpler parts to really get the connection ... ... between quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics. To understand the atom-to-atom interaction, we have to look at the interactions of the subatomic constituents. And here we start with a typical nucleus-electron interaction. The attractive force between a nucleus and an electron can be derived by the Coulomb potential. As we learned before, this force is equal to the rate of change of momentum, which of cause applies to both particles. And for constant mass, the rate of change of momentum is just mass times acceleration. So, given the same force, the heavier nucleus builds up motion much slower ... ... and can as well be seen as ‚Äúnot moving‚Äù from the super-agile electron perspective. In contrast, from the viewpoint of the nucleus, an electron reacts almost instantaneously. This works equally well in a quantum mechanical perspective. Here, the probability of detecting the electron changes way faster compared to the nucleus probability. It all looks as if nuclei and electrons live in two different worlds, at least motion-wise. In this sense, the computational treatment of the motion of multiple electrons and nuclei can be decoupled ... ... as if they live in two different simulations and they only interact in a mathematically simplified way. The nuclei do wander around ‚Äì as particles in the end, and provide possible fixed positions for the electron simulation. The electrons in return take these fixed locations and provide potential energy values, ... ... from which the forces between the nuclei can be derived. Now, to compute these potential energy values, a wave function purely for the electrons is constructed, ... ... which considers the nuclei with their Coulomb potential at fixed positions. And here is the trick... We are not interested in any possible electron wave function, ... ... but the one that electrons reach over time due to energy loss by radiation, the one with the lowest energy. Why? Because that is the one that the slower nuclei effectively see most of the time! Remember, from their perspective, the electrons react so quickly; ... ... the final electron wave function seems to be built up almost instantaneously. Now, what is the final wave function? It is the first standing wave, and the energy is related to its frequency of oscillation. The exact shape of this standing wave depends obviously on the problem. For a single hydrogen atom, it is one of the electron-clouds I showed at the beginning. And for the abstract ‚Äì one particle ‚Äì example it is one of the shapes we used for reduction. But the actual shape is not so important. It is the associated energy value that is interesting. And the first standing wave with its frequency truly marks the lowest possible energy in each particular setting. By repeatedly computing these lowest energy values for different nuclei positions, ... ... we get a so-called inter-atomic potential energy surface. And its derivative gives the net force between nuclei. As you can see, the full development of this potential is explanatory but also exhausting, ... ... so you often bypass the whole process by using empirical approximations like the Lennard Jones potential, ... ... or in this case of interatomic bonding the Morse potential. And the propagation of the nuclei within this inter-atomic potential happens either as a wave function itself ... ... or as particles. The particle approximation for the nuclei is here reasonable, ... ... since the higher spread in momentum, that follows from the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for more and more localized particles, ... ... is mostly established by the higher nuclei mass, ... ... keeping the velocity spread low and so the future position spread still slow. Ok, there is so much more to all of this, ... ... and I have to admit, answering any one question leaves us immediately with five new questions. So, we will dig into quantum mechanics in much greater detail in another series. For our goal here of simulating fluids, we are good to go by knowing that ‚Ä¶ ... with these key assumptions we can simulate atoms as particles moving on trajectories within potentials. So, atoms can form molecules, which can move or translate, rotate, collide, vibrate and so on. The vibration within a molecule usually happens on much smaller length scales (according to Molecular Dynamics!). I really exaggerated it here to make it visible. And the accuracy of the molecular dynamics approximation depends highly on the conditions of the system. So, while we are mainly in a classical mechanics setting, ... ... more or less parts of the simulation can still be represented quantum mechanically. It depends on what accuracy you want to achieve. Here, we go fully classical mechanics from now on. So, finally, to set the simulation up, we need to specify parameters for the masses and potentials. And what is now usually done, and makes this an empirical approach, is to set these values in such a way, ... ... that the statistical behavior that can be drawn from many molecule interactions ... ... matches up to what measurements suggest. So, it fits on average, at least in the range of conditions you developed it for. Ok, you are not really comparing trajectories, but derived quantities that are easier to measure. Let‚Äôs just assume that we somehow found good parameter values. What we can do now is to replace the inter-molecular potential-based interactions by instantaneous collisions; ... ... this will cut the computational cost even further. Instantaneous collisions are just faster to compute, you basically reflect velocities, ... ... and it is ok here, since it is empirical anyway. We can modify parameters for both variants to yield similar results ... ... at least when viewed from a more distant perspective. You see, we are slowly embracing a more classical statistical perspective here. We get more precise about what ‚Äúviewed from a distance‚Äù means when we talk about the next layer of abstraction. See this example here as a glimpse on how we might reduce information in the upcoming layers, ... ... by keeping an eye on the global dynamics. And just to be clear, ... ... the reduction due to molecular dynamics is not only established by combining sub-atomic particles and simplifying potentials. Remember, it is much more due to very nature ... ... how the simulation processes can be decomposed within different mechanical realms. In quantum mechanics, the high dimensional position space of the joint probability ... ... is an inherent part of the simulation, increasing the computational costs at every iteration significantly. In classical mechanics, you can also talk in terms of probabilities. But you may first compute a bunch of trajectories in phase space and average afterwards ... ... which totals up to less computational cost. At least you have the option to trade-off statistical significance for computing fewer trajectories. So, entering a classical mechanics setting is a huge leap forward concerning the fluid volume that we can simulate. Given my limited hardware and my focus here on writing rather educational code; ... ... compared to quantum mechanics, where we may simulate a few sub-atomic particles (without modes), ... ... in molecular dynamics, we can at least come up with some 100,000 atoms. So, we increase the fluid volume we can simulate by ‚Ä¶ Well, let‚Äôs say we start having a volume at all! Ok, we are slowly building, what could be called a fluid. And looking at what we have done so far, the next layer should come as no surprise. It simply carries the assumptions of molecular dynamics one step further. The kinetic theory of gases. So, as we combined subatomic particles to form atom particles, ... ... the next logical step is to combine atom particles to form molecule particles. And the name says it all: it is a theory of GASES. So, it should work best when particles are spread out and ... ... the free flight phases in between interactions take way longer than the interactions themselves. Therefore, these mostly repelling interactions can as well be seen as instantaneous collisions, ... ... exactly as in our simplified molecular dynamics simulation. Intuitively it seems reasonable, but let‚Äôs have a look how it works out step by step. The approach represents a molecule by a single point mass with an effective collision radius. Ok, the mass should be about the sum of its components, but what about the radius? Let‚Äôs figure that out by an experiment, ... ... and we use the standard molecular dynamics simulation with the empirical potentials to emphasize the problem. Here we shoot molecules with the same total energy towards each other ... ... with a fixed offset between their pre-collision trajectories. The total energy here comprises the kinetic energy from the atoms motion as well as the potential energy from the inter-atomic bonding. Not surprisingly, we have a typical scattering pattern. Now we repeat this experiment with the molecule particles. Since these are only point masses with an effective collision radius, the outcome is always the same. This model simply does not hold the capacity to represent more complex behavior. But this is good; this is our chance to trade off accuracy for computational speed. Our task is now to wisely choose a radius that fits best for the situation. So, like this perhaps. But, we got a problem ... As we change the distance of the pre-collision trajectories, the chosen radius is not so optimal anymore. So we would be better off choosing a radius that fits all experiments. But that‚Äôs a bit tricky. If molecules pass each other at a distance where the attractive part of the potential is dominant, ... ... we mostly see a kind of a slingshot maneuver, which cannot be represented by our pure collision model. Well, we could perform multiple experiments with different initial distances and energies and so on, ... ... and see which radius works best for most of them. But how do we weight the influence of each of these experiments on the final choice of the radius? Well, simply by not simulating separate experiments but by simulating the fluid directly as a whole. The pre-collision conditions of all these little individual interactions ... ... will have obviously the randomness they would experience in a fluid, ... ... simply by being in a fluid! And remember, the fluid we build should work in an averaged sense anyway, ... ... so we have to compare its global statistical behavior with the global statistical behavior of the fluid we try to replace. Here, we naively focus on just one statistic ‚Äì the particle mixing in different layers ‚Äì or impurity. But there are a ton of possible global statistics to look at. So, what it all means is, we shouldn‚Äôt think particle-interaction-wise, but overall-fluid-wise. The particles are still there in the simulation, but we shift our focus to the bigger picture. Under this relaxed perspective it is fine if the fluid works globally, despite having local differences. So, these are the key assumptions that allow us to model fluid molecules as a collection of colliding particles, ... ... which concludes the microscopic perspective. In the next part we use this model to derive a very powerful level of abstraction ... ... that enables us to simulate the flow on arbitrarily large scales ‚Äì the macroscopic perspective. And we will learn how concepts such as pressure, viscosity, temperature, or flow velocity ... ... appear in a super intuitive way by studying the motion and interaction of these molecules. Let‚Äôs recap and highlight what we accomplished so far. We started out by realizing that we have practical limits and more so theoretical limits ... ... about what we can ever know about the elementary particles that make up fluids. This circumstance made probabilities appear in a very natural way. And the probabilistic perspective proved to be a far more general guiding principle ... ... to derive more and more abstract models. The quintessential steps we toke led us from a full quantum mechanical treatment that considered every possible state ... ... more and more to a relaxed perspective on what information we actually need to keep track of. The real game changer here was our leap from quantum mechanics to classical mechanics, ... ... enabling both, the treatment of fluids as a collection of particles with individual trajectories ... ... and in that way also having a scalable approach for modelling probabilistically on demand. And guided by our ultimate goal of reducing information we finally arrived at the kinetic theory of gases ... ... which will be our entry point for understanding fluid flow as a collective behavior of many individual interactions. But most of these steps really just embody our attempt in looking for opportunities to average out information. The single one message I want you to take home is: ... every seemingly complex problem, can be broken down into simpler parts ... ... and we can solve them step by step; ... ... looking for the patterns and trying to find the underlying guiding principles ... ... that really connect all the pieces. Once you have a clear focus on your main challenge ‚Äì here it was reducing information ‚Äì ... ... the next steps will become more and more obvious. In that way, methods that may be intimidating at first, ... ... such as quantum mechanics and fluid simulation, will start to render as natural consequences, ... ... making them far more believable. Alright, see you in the next part."

        "transcription": "Thanks to CuriosityStream for sponsoring¬†\nthis video. Watch thousands of documentaries¬†¬† and get access to Nebula for free, when you¬†\nsign up using the link in the description.\n¬† Bernoulli's equation is a simple but incredibly¬†\nimportant equation in physics and engineering¬†¬† that can help us understand a lot about the flow¬†\nof fluids in the world around us. It essentially¬†¬† describes the relationship between the pressure,¬†\nvelocity and elevation of a flowing fluid.\n¬† It has countless applications. We can use¬†\nit to explain how planes generate lift,¬†¬† or to calculate how fast liquid will¬†\ndrain from a container, for example.\n¬† We'll explore these applications and a¬†\nfew more later on, but let's start by¬†¬† reviewing the equation itself.   \nIt was first published by the Swiss¬†¬† physicist Daniel Bernoulli in¬†\n1738, and it looks like this.\n¬† The equation states that the sum of these three¬†\nterms remains constant along a streamline.¬†¬† Each of the terms is a pressure. \nThe first term is the static pressure,¬†¬† which is just the pressure P of the fluid.\nThen we have the dynamic pressure¬†¬† which is a function of the fluid density¬†\nRho and velocity V, and represents the¬†¬† fluid kinetic energy per unit volume.\nAnd the last term is the hydrostatic pressure,¬†¬† which is the pressure exerted by the fluid due¬†\nto gravity. G is gravitational acceleration¬†¬† and H is the elevation of the fluid, which is¬†\njust its height above a reference level.\n¬† This is the pressure form of the equation,¬†\nbut it can also be presented in the head form,¬†¬† and the energy form.\nWe can think of Bernoulli's¬†¬† equation as a statement of the conservation¬†\nof energy. It says that along a streamline¬†¬† the sum of the pressure energy, kinetic energy¬†\nand potential energy remains constant. This is¬†¬† really valuable information that can help us¬†\nanalyse a whole range of fluid flow problems.\n¬† The equation does have a few limitations,¬†\nwhich I'll cover later on in the video,¬†¬† but for now the important thing to note is¬†\nthat it can only be applied along a streamline.¬†¬† We can define a streamline in steady flow as the¬†\npath traced by a single particle within the fluid.¬†¬† Or more technically as a curve that at all points¬†\nis tangent to the particle velocity vector.\n¬† Let's look at an example where¬†\nwe apply Bernoulli's equation¬†¬† to flow through a pipe which has a change in¬†\ndiameter. We want to use the equation to see¬†¬† how the pressure changes as the flow passes¬†\nfrom the larger to the smaller diameter.\n¬† Bernoulli's equation is usually used to¬†\ncompare the flow at two different locations,¬†¬† so we can rewrite it like this, with points¬†\n1 and 2 both being on the same streamline.\n¬† There‚Äôs no significant change in¬†\nelevation between Points 1 and 2,¬†¬† so the potential energy terms cancel each¬†\nother out. And if we put all of the static¬†¬† pressure terms on one side we get this¬†\nequation for the change in pressure.\n¬† If we assume that the fluid is incompressible,¬†\nthe mass flow rate at points 1 and 2¬†¬† must be equal. This gives us what‚Äôs called the¬†\ncontinuity equation, which is just a statement¬†¬† of the conservation of mass. Mass flow rate¬†\nis equal to the product of the fluid density,¬†¬† the pipe cross-sectional¬†\narea and the fluid velocity.¬†¬† So we can re-arrange the continuity equation to¬†\nobtain an equation for the velocity at point 2.¬†¬† The cross-sectional area A2 is smaller than¬†\nA1, which means that the velocity of the¬†¬† flow increases as it passes into the smaller¬†\ndiameter pipe. This is quite intuitive.\n¬† By substituting this equation for V2 into¬†\nBernoulli's equation, we can see that since the¬†¬† velocity increases between Points 1 and 2, the¬†\npressure between both points must decrease.\n¬† This concept, that for horizontal flow an¬†\nincrease in fluid velocity must be accompanied¬†¬† by a decrease in pressure, is one way of¬†\nformulating what we call Bernoulli's Principle.\n¬† It can seem counter-intuitive,¬†\nbecause people often expect an¬†¬† increase in velocity to result in a¬†\ncorresponding increase in pressure.¬†¬† But it makes sense if we think about the¬†\nconservation of energy. The energy required¬†¬† to increase the fluid velocity comes at the¬†\nexpense of the static pressure energy.\n¬† Bernoulli‚Äôs Principle shows up¬†\nin a lot of different places.\n¬† We can use it to help explain how plane¬†\nwings generate lift. Fluid flowing over¬†¬† an airfoil travels faster¬†\nthan fluid flowing below it.¬†¬† According to Bernoulli's Principle this creates¬†\nan area of low pressure above the airfoil and¬†¬† an area of high pressure below it, and it‚Äôs¬†\nthis pressure difference that generates lift.¬†¬† I'll cover lift and drag forces in¬†\nmore detail in a separate video.\n¬† Bernoulli's Principle also explains¬†\nhow Bunsen burners work.\n¬† When the gas valve is opened, gas flows into the¬†\nbarrel at high velocity. Following Bernoulli‚Äôs¬†¬† Principle, this high velocity creates an area¬†\nof low pressure in the barrel, which draws¬†¬† air in through the air regulator, allowing¬†\nfor more complete combustion of the gas.\n¬† Several different flow measurement¬†\ndevices rely on Bernoulli‚Äôs equation¬†¬† to determine the velocity of a flowing fluid.\nThe Pitot-static tube is one such device.¬†¬† It‚Äôs often used in aircraft to measure¬†\nairspeed. Here‚Äôs how it works.  \n¬† If we place a tube into a flowing fluid,¬†\nlike this, and we attach a pressure meter¬†¬† to the end of it, the meter will measure¬†\nthe pressure at the end of the tube.¬†¬† At this point the fluid velocity is reduced¬†\nto zero, so it‚Äôs called the stagnation point,¬†¬† and the pressure measured by the meter¬†\nis called the stagnation pressure.\n¬† We can apply Bernoulli‚Äôs equation between¬†\nan upstream point and the stagnation point,¬†¬† and show that the stagnation pressure is¬†\nequal to the sum of the static pressure¬†¬† and the dynamic pressure terms. All of the¬†\nkinetic energy is essentially being converted¬†¬† into pressure energy at the stagnation point.\nIf we add an outer tube which is sealed at the end¬†¬† but has holes further downstream, the outer tube¬†\nwill measure the static pressure of the fluid,¬†¬† instead of the stagnation pressure.\nThese two pressure measurements give¬†¬† us all of the information we need to¬†\ndetermine the velocity of the flow.\n¬† Another flow measurement device¬†\nthat uses Bernoulli‚Äôs equation¬†¬† is the Venturi meter, which is an instrument¬†\nused to determine the flowrate through a pipe.¬†¬† It works by measuring the pressure drop¬†\nacross a converging section of the pipe.\n¬† Say we want to determine the flow rate Q,¬†\nwhich is the velocity multiplied by the¬†¬† pipe cross-sectional area at Point 1. We can¬†\neasily rearrange the pressure drop equation¬†¬† we derived earlier when we looked at a change¬†\nin diameter, to get this equation for flowrate.¬†¬† All we need to know is the¬†\ndimensions of the Venturi meter,¬†¬† the fluid density and the pressures P1 and P2,¬†\nand that allows us to calculate the flowrate.\n¬† The Venturi meter has no moving parts¬†\nand is a very simple and reliable way¬†¬† of measuring the flowrate through a pipe.¬†\nThe diverging section is longer than the¬†¬† converging section to reduce the likelihood of¬†\nflow separation and keep energy losses low.\n¬† Let's look at one more example where¬†\nwe can apply Bernoulli's equation.\n¬† Say we have a beer keg, and we want to¬†\ncalculate how fast will drain when we¬†¬† first open the tap at the bottom.¬†\nAll we need to do is define our two¬†¬† points along a streamline and¬†\napply Bernoulli's equation.\n¬† It‚Äôs a gravity-fed keg with a vent at the top,¬†\nmeaning that it‚Äôs not pressurised. The pressure¬†¬† at both points will be atmospheric, and so the¬†\nstatic pressure terms cancel each other out.\n¬† We can also assume that the keg¬†\nis large enough that the fluid¬†¬† velocity at Point 1 is close to zero. If we rearrange Bernoulli‚Äôs equation,¬†¬† and define the height between¬†\nthe beer level and the tap as H,¬†¬† we get this equation for the¬†\nbeer velocity out of the tap.\n¬† Those were a few examples of cases where we¬†\ncan apply Bernoulli's equation to get some¬†¬† valuable information or to solve a problem. But to use it correctly, it‚Äôs important to have an¬†¬† understanding of the limitations of the equation,¬†\nwhich arise because of how it‚Äôs derived.\n¬† There are several different ways¬†\nBernoulli‚Äôs equation can be derived.\n¬† It can be derived based on conservation of¬†\nenergy, by considering that the work done¬†¬† on the fluid increases its kinetic energy.\nOr it can be derived by applying Newton's second¬†¬† law, which involves determining the forces acting¬†\non a fluid particle and applying F equals M*A.\n¬† Although I won't cover either derivation¬†\nhere, they do both make some assumptions¬†¬† that we need to be aware of, since they¬†\nlimit how we can apply the equation.\n¬† Firstly the derivation of Bernoulli‚Äôs equation¬†¬† assumes that flow is laminar and that it is¬†\nsteady, meaning that it doesn't vary with time.\n¬† Next, it assumes that the flow is inviscid,¬†\nmeaning that shear forces due to fluid¬†¬† viscosity are negligible. This assumption¬†\nis needed because viscosity would result¬†¬† in a dissipation of some of the fluid‚Äôs internal¬†\nenergy, and so the idea that energy is conserved¬†¬† along a streamline would no longer apply.\nAnd finally the derivation of Bernoulli's¬†¬† equation assumes that the fluid behaves as if it‚Äôs¬†\nincompressible. This is usually valid for liquids,¬†¬† but might not be for gases at high velocities.\nAll three of these assumptions need to be valid if¬†¬† you want to apply Bernoulli's equation. \nAdapted versions of the equation which can¬†¬† be applied to unsteady and compressible flows do¬†\nexist, although they‚Äôre a bit more complicated.\n¬† Being able to recognise when Bernoulli‚Äôs¬†\nPrinciple is at play, or when Bernoulli‚Äôs¬†¬† equation can be applied to solve a problem,¬†\nis a powerful tool in any engineer's arsenal.\n¬† If you'd like to see a few more real world¬†\nexamples of Bernoulli‚Äôs principle in action,¬†¬† you can check out the extended¬†\nversion of this video on Nebula.\n¬† Nebula is a video streaming service, built¬†\nentirely by educational creators like myself.\n¬† It‚Äôs home to some of the best creators¬†\nout there, including Real Engineering,¬†¬† Practical Engineering, and City Beautiful, so¬†\nyou can watch content from them and many others¬†¬† on Nebula, completely ad free.\nAll of my videos are on Nebula,¬†¬† without any ads, and in the version¬†\nof this video on Nebula, I've replaced¬†¬† this sponsorship message with a few more really¬†\ninteresting examples of Bernoulli's principle.\n¬† Then there‚Äôs the growing catalogue of exclusive¬†\nNebula Originals that you won‚Äôt be able to watch¬†¬† anywhere else, like Mustard‚Äôs fascinating look¬†\nat Imperial Japan‚Äôs Underwater Aircraft Carriers,¬†¬† or the Logistics of D Day series.\nAnd best of all, you can get access to Nebula¬†¬† for free when you sign up to CuriosityStream¬†\nusing the link in the description.\n¬† CuriosityStream is the streaming¬†\nservice for high quality documentaries.¬†¬† It has a catalogue of thousands of incredible¬†\ntitles, covering engineering, science, history¬†¬† and more.
